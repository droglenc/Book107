The discovery of contamination from creosote waste in the subsoils and ground water at Kreher Park prompted the city to abandon the project. A subsequent assessment by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) indicated elevated levels of hazardous substances in soil borings, ground water samples, and in the sediments of Chequamegon Bay directly offshore of Kreher Park. In 1995 and 1999, the Northern States Power Company conducted investigations that further defined the area of contamination and confirmed the presence of specific contaminants associated with coal tar wastes. This site is now listed as a superfund site and is being given considerably more attention.1 Figure 1.1: Location of the Ashland superfund site (left) with the location of 119 historical sediment sampling sites (right). The WDNR wants to study elements in the sediment (among other things) in the entire 3000 m2 area shaded in Figure 1.1. Is it physically possible to examine every square meter of that area? Is it prudent, ecologically and economically, to examine every square meter of this area? The answer, of course, is no. How then will the WDNR be able to make conclusions about this entire area if they cannot reasonably examine the whole area? The most reasonable solution is to sample a subset of the area and use the results from this sample to make inferences about the entire area. Methods for properly selecting a sample that fairly represents a larger collection of individuals are an important area of study in statistics. For example, the WDNR would not want to sample areas that are only conveniently near shore because this will likely not be an accurate representation of the entire area. In this example, it appears that the WDNR used a grid to assure a relatively even dispersal of samples throughout the study area (Figure 1.1). Methods for choosing the number of individuals to select and how to select those individuals are discussed in Module 3. Suppose that the WDNR measured the concentration of lead at each of the 119 locations shown in Figure 1.1. Further suppose that they presented their results at a public meeting by simply showing the list of lead concentration measurements (Table 1.1).2 Is it easy to make conclusions about what these data mean from this type of presentation? Table 1.1: Lead concentration (\\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\)) from 119 sites in Kreher Park superfund site. 0.91 1.09 1.00 1.09 1.06 0.98 0.98 0.94 0.89 1.09 0.91 1.06 0.81 0.90 1.21 1.03 0.95 1.14 0.99 0.99 0.96 1.13 0.84 1.03 0.86 0.98 1.04 0.91 1.27 0.90 0.87 1.23 1.12 0.98 0.79 1.10 1.06 1.09 0.73 0.81 1.18 0.92 0.82 1.11 0.97 1.24 1.06 1.09 0.78 0.94 1.08 0.91 0.98 1.22 1.04 0.77 1.18 0.93 1.14 0.94 1.05 0.91 1.14 0.93 0.94 0.90 1.05 1.36 1.02 0.93 1.09 1.17 0.91 1.06 0.95 0.88 0.67 1.12 1.06 0.99 0.89 0.83 0.99 1.33 1.00 1.05 1.11 1.01 1.25 0.96 1.07 1.17 1.01 1.20 1.17 1.05 1.21 1.10 1.07 1.01 1.16 1.24 0.86 0.90 1.07 1.11 0.99 0.70 0.98 1.11 1.12 1.30 1.00 0.89 0.91 0.95 1.08 1.02 0.93 Instead, suppose that the scientists brought a simple plot of the frequency of observed lead concentrations and brief numerical summaries (Figure 1.2) to the meeting. With these one can easily see that the measurements were fairly symmetric with no obviously weird values. The lead concentrations ranged from as low as 0.67 \\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\) to as high as 1.36 \\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\) with the measurements centered on approximately 1.0 \\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\). These summaries are discussed in detail in Module 4. However, at this point, note that summarizing large quantities of data with few graphical or numerical summaries makes it is easier to identify meaning from data. Figure 1.2: Histogram and summary statistics of lead concentration measurements (\\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\)) at each of 119 sites in Kreher Park superfund site. A critical question at this point is whether or not the results from the one sample of 119 sites perfectly represents the results for the entire area. One way to consider this question is to examine the results obtained from another sample of 119 sites. The results from this second sample (Figure 1.3) are clearly, though not radically, different from the results of the first sample. Thus, it is seen that any one sample from a larger whole will not perfectly represent the large whole. This will lead to some uncertainty in our summaries of the larger whole. Figure 1.3: Histogram and summary statistics of lead concentration measurements (\\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\)) at each of 119 sites (different from the sites shown in Figure 1.2) in Kreher Park superfund site. The results from two different samples do not perfectly agree because each sample contains different individuals (sites in this example), and no two individuals are exactly alike. The fact that no two individuals are exactly alike is natural variability, because of the natural differences that occur among individuals. The fact that the results from different samples are different is called sampling variability. If there was no natural variability, then there would be no sampling variability. If there was no sampling variability, then the field of statistics would not be needed because a sample (even of one individual) would perfectly represent the larger group of individuals. Thus, understanding variability is at the core of statistical practice. Natural and sampling variability will be revisited continuously throughout this course. This may be unsettling! First, it was shown that an entire area or all of the individuals of interest cannot be examined. It was then shown that a sample of individuals from the larger whole did not perfectly represent the larger whole. Furthermore, each sample is unique and will likely lead to a (slightly) different conclusion. These are all real and difficult issues faced by the practicing scientist and considered by the informed consumer. However, the field of statistics is designed to deal with these issues such that the results from a relatively small subset of measurements can be used to make conclusions about the entire collection of measurements. Statistics provides methods for overcoming the difficulties caused by the requirement of sampling and the presence of sampling variability. 1.2 Major Goals of Statistics As seen in the Kreher Park example, the field of statistics has two primary purposes. First, statistics provides methods to summarize large quantities of data into concise and informative numerical or graphical summaries. For example, it was easier to discern the general underlying structure of the lead measurements from the statistics and histograms presented in Figures 1.2 and 1.3, than it was from the full list of lead measurements in Table 1.1. Second, statistical methods allow inferences to be made about all individuals (i.e., a population) from a few individuals (i.e., a sample).3 1.3 Definition of Statistics Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, and interpreting numerical information or data (Moore and McCabe 1998). People study statistics for a variety of reasons, including (Bluman 2000): To understand the statistical studies performed in their field (i.e., be knowledgeable about the vocabulary, symbols, concepts, and statistical procedures used in those studies). To conduct research in their field (i.e., be able to design experiments and samples; collect, organize, analyze, and summarize data; make reliable predictions or forecasts for future use; and communicate statistical results). To be better consumers of statistical information. Statistics permeates a wide variety of disciplines. Moore and McCabe (1998) state: The study and collection of data are important in the work of many professions, so that training in the science of statistics is valuable preparation for a variety of careers. Each month, for example, government statistical offices release the latest numerical information on unemployment and inflation. Economists and financial advisers, as well as policy makers in government and business study these data in order to make informed decisions. Doctors must understand the origin and trustworthiness of the data that appear in medical journals if they are to offer their patients the most effective treatments. Politicians rely on data from polls of public opinion. Business decisions are based on market research data that reveal customer tastes. Farmers study data from field trials of new crop varieties. Engineers gather data on the quality and reliability of manufactured products. Most areas of academic study make use of numbers, and therefore also make use of the methods of statistics. 1.4 Why Does Statistics (as a tool) Exist? Besides demonstrating the two major goals of statistics, the Kreher Park example illustrates three realities that exist in nature and life that necessitate the need for statistics as tool for understanding. First, in most realistic situations it is not possible or, at least, not reasonable to see the entire population. For example, it was not reasonable to sample the sediments throughout the entire contaminated area near Kreher Park. In other examples, is it possible (or reasonable) to examine every Northern Short-Tailed Shew (Blarina bevicauda) in Great Lakes states, every person of legal voting age in Wisconsin, or every click on Facebook? Second, as described above, variability exists, both among individuals and results of samples. Third, because we must take samples from populations and those samples are both imperfect representations of the population and sampling variability exists, our conclusions about the population are uncertain. For example, the first sample in the Kreher Park example suggested that the mean lead concentration was 1.02 \\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\), whereas the second sample was 0.98 \\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\). You have also seen this concept when the margin-of-error in poll results are presented. In summary, statistics exist because we must sample instead of observe entire populations, variability is ever present, and the conclusions from samples are uncertain. More information at the EPA and the WDNR websites. These are hypothetical data for this site. Population and sample are defined more completely in Section 2.1. "],["FoundationalDefns.html", "Module 2 Foundational Definitions 2.1 Definitions 2.2 Performing an IVPPSS 2.3 Variable Types", " Module 2 Foundational Definitions Statistical inference is the process of forming conclusions about a parameter of a population from statistics computed from individuals in a sample.4 Thus, understanding statistical inference requires understanding the difference between a population and a sample and a parameter and a statistic. And, to properly describe those items, the individual and variable(s) of interest must be identified. Understanding and identifying these six items is the focus of this module. The following hypothetical example is used throughout this module. Assume that we are interested in the average length of 1015 fish in Square Lake. To illustrate important concepts in this module, assume that all information for all 1015 fish in this lake is known (Figure 2.1). In real life this complete information would not be known. Figure 2.1: Schematic representation of individual fish (i.e., dots; Left) and histogram (Right) of the total length of the 1015 fish in Square Lake. 2.1 Definitions The individual in a statistical analysis is one of the items examined by the researcher. Sometimes the individual is a person, but it may be an animal, a piece of wood, a location, a particular time, or an event. It is extremely important that you dont always visualize a person when considering an individual in a statistical sense. Synonyms for individual are unit, experimental unit (usually used in experiments), sampling unit (usually used in observational studies), case, and subject (usually used in studies involving humans). An individual in the Square Lake example is a fish, because the researcher will collect a set of fish and examine each individual fish. The variable is the characteristic recorded about each individual. The variable in the Square Lake example is the length of each fish. In most studies, the researcher will record more than one variable. For example, the researcher may also record the fishs weight, sex, age, time of capture, and location of capture. In this module, only one variable is considered. In other modules, two variables will be considered. A population is ALL individuals of interest. In the Square Lake example, the population is all 1015 fish in the lake. The population should be defined as thoroughly as possible including qualifiers, especially those related to time and space, as necessary. This example is simple because Square Lake is so well defined; however, as you will see in the review exercises, the population is often only well-defined by your choice of descriptors. A parameter is a summary computed from ALL individuals in a population. The term for the particular summary is usually preceded by the word population. For example, the population average length of all 1015 fish in Square Lake is 98.06 mm and the population standard deviation is 31.49 mm (Table 2.1).5 Parameters are ultimately what is of interest, because interest is in all individuals in the population. However, in practice, parameters cannot be computed because the entire population cannot usually be seen. Table 2.1: Parameters for the total length of ALL 1015 fish in the Square Lake population. n mean sd min Q1 median Q3 max 1015 98.06 31.49 39 72 93 117 203 The entire population cannot beseen in real life. Thus, to learn something about the population, a subset of the population is usually examined. This subset is called a sample. The red dots in Figure 2.2 represent a random sample of n=50 fish from Square Lake (note that the sample size is usually denoted by n). Figure 2.2: Schematic representation (Left) of a sample of 50 fish (i.e., red dots) from Square Lake and histogram (Right) of the total length of the 50 fish in this sample. Summaries computed from individuals in a sample are called statistics. Specific names of statistics are preceded bysample. The statistic of interest is always the same as the parameter of interest; i.e., the statistic describes the sample in the same way that the parameter describes the population. For example, if interest is in the population mean, then the sample mean would be computed. Some statistics computed from the sample from Square Lake are shown in Table 2.2 and Figure 2.2. The sample mean of 107.5 mm is the bestguess at the population mean. Not surprisingly from the discussion in Module 1, the sample mean does not perfectly equal the population mean. Table 2.2: Summary statistics for the total length of a sample of 50 fish from the Square Lake population. n mean sd min Q1 median Q3 max 50 107.5 34.26 57 77.25 107.5 134.75 171 An individual is not necessarily a person. Populations and parameters can generally not beseen. 2.2 Performing an IVPPSS In each statistical analysis it is important that you determine the Individual, Variable, Population, Parameter, Sample, and Statistic (IVPPSS). First, determine what items you are actually going to look at; those are the individuals. Second, determine what is recorded about each individual; that is the variable. Third, ALL individuals is the population. Fourth, the summary (e.g., mean or proportion) of the variable recorded from ALL individuals in the population is the parameter.6 Fifth, the population usually cannot be seen, so only a few individuals are examined; those few individuals are the sample. Finally, the summary of the individuals in the sample is the statistic. When performing an IVPPSS, keep in mind that parameters describe populations (note that they both start withp) and statistics describe samples (note that they both start withs). This can also be looked at from another perspective. A sample is an estimate of the population and a statistic is an estimate of a parameter. Thus, the statistic has to be the same summary (mean or proportion) of the sample as the parameter is of the population. The IVPPSS process is illustrated for the following situation: A University of New Hampshire graduate student (and Northland College alum) investigated habitat utilization by New England (Sylvilagus transitionalis) and Eastern (Sylvilagus floridanus) cottontail rabbits in eastern Maine in 2007. In a preliminary portion of his research he determined the proportion of rabbit patches that were inhabited by New England cottontails. He examined 70 patches and found that 53 showed evidence of inhabitance by New England cottontails. An individual is a rabbit patch in eastern Maine in 2007 (i.e., a rabbit patch is the item being sampled and examined). The variable is evidence for New England cottontails or not (yes or no) (i.e., the characteristic of each rabbit patch that was recorded). The population is ALL rabbit patches in eastern Maine in 2007. The parameter is the proportion of ALL rabbit patches in eastern Maine in 2007 that showed evidence for New England cottontails.7 The sample is the 70 rabbit patches from eastern Maine in 2007 that were actually examined by the researcher. The statistic is the proportion of the 70 rabbit patches from eastern Maine in 2007 actually examined that showed evidence for New England cottontails. [In this case, the statistic would be 53/70 or 0.757.] In the descriptions above, take note that the individual is very carefully defined (including stating a specific time (2007) and place (eastern Maine)), the population and parameter both use the word ALL, the sample and statistic both use the specific sample size (70 rabbits), and that the parameter and statistics both use the same summary (i.e., proportion of patches that showed evidence of New England cottontails). In some situations it may be easier to identify the sample first. From this, and realizing that a sample is always of the individuals, it may be easier to identify the individual. This process is illustrated in the following example, with the items listed in the order identified rather than in the traditional IVPPSS order. The Duluth, MN Touristry Board is interested in the average number of raptors seen per year at Hawk Ridge.8 To determine this value, they collected the total number of raptors seen in a sample of years from 1971-2003. The sample is the 32 years between 1971 and 2003 at Hawk Ridge. An individual is a year (because a sample of years was taken) at Hawk Ridge. The variable recorded was the number of raptors seen in one year at Hawk Ridge. The population is ALL years at Hawk Ridge (this is a bit ambiguous but may be thought of as all years that Hawk Ridge has existed). The parameter is the average number of raptors seen per year in ALL years at Hawk Ridge. The statistic is the average number of raptors seen in the 1971-2003 sample of years at Hawk Ridge. Again, note that the individual is very carefully defined (including stating a specific time and place), the population and parameter both use the word ALL, the sample and statistic both use the specific sample size (32 years), and that the parameter and statistics both use the same summary (i.e., average number of raptors). An individual is usually defined by a specific time and place. Descriptions for population and parameter will always include the word All. Descriptions for sample and statistic will contain the specific sample size. Descriptions for parameter and statistic will contain the same summary (usually average/mean or proportion/percentage). Howeve the summary is for a different set of individuals  the population for the parameter and the sample for the statistic. 2.2.1 Sampling Variability (Revisited) It is instructive to once again (see Module 1) consider how statistics differ among samples. Table 2.3 and Figure 2.3 show results from three more samples of n=50 fish from the Square Lake population. The means from all four samples (including the sample in Table 2.2 and Figure 2.2) were quite different from the known population mean of 98.06 mm. Similarly, all four histograms were similar in appearance but slightly different in actual values. These results illustrate that a statistic (or sample) will only approximate the parameter (or population) and that statistics vary among samples. This sampling variability is one of the most important concepts in statistics and is discussed in great detail beginning in Module 11. Figure 2.3: Schematic representation (Left) of three samples of 50 fish (i.e., red dots) from Square Lake and histograms (Right) of the total length of the 50 fish in each sample. Table 2.3: Summary statistics for the total length in three samples of 50 fish from the Square Lake population. n mean sd min Q1 median Q3 max 2 50 100.48 31.87 45 78.25 99.5 120.00 180 3 50 99.40 38.28 47 69.00 90.5 113.75 203 4 50 98.14 32.26 45 71.25 87.0 121.50 174 Sampling Variability: The realization that no two samples are exactly alike. Thus, statistics computed from different samples will likely vary. This example also illustrates that parameters are fixed values because populations dont change. If a population does change, then it is considered a different population. In the Square Lake example, if a fish is removed from the lake, then the fish in the lake would be considered a different population. Statistics, on the other hand, vary depending on the sample because each sample consists of different individuals that vary (i.e., sampling variability exists because natural variability exists). Parameters are fixed in value, while statistics vary in value. 2.3 Variable Types The type of statistic that can be calculated is dictated by the type of variable recorded. For example, an average can only be calculated for quantitative variables (defined below). Thus, the type of variable should be identified immediately after performing an IVPPSS. 2.3.1 Variable Definitions There are two main groups of variable types  quantitative and categorical (Figure 2.4). Quantitative variables are variables with numerical values for which it makes sense to do arithmetic operations (like adding or averaging). Synonyms for quantitative are measurement or numerical. Categorical variables are variables that record which group or category an individual belongs. Synonyms for categorical are qualitative or attribute. Within each main type of variable are two subgroups (Figure 2.4). Figure 2.4: Schematic representation of the four types of variables. The two types of quantitative variables are continuous and discrete variables. Continuous variables are quantitative variables that have an uncountable number of values. In other words, a potential value does exist between every pair of values of a continuous variable. Discrete variables are quantitative variables that have a countable number of values. Stated differently, a potential value does not exist between every pair of values for a discrete variable. Typically, but not always, discrete variables are counts of items. Continuous and discrete variables are easily distinguished by determining if it is possible for a value to exist between every two values of the variable. For example, can there be between 2 and 3 ducks on a pond? No! Thus, the number of ducks is a discrete variable. Alternatively, can a duck weigh between 2 and 3 kg? Yes! Can it weigh between 2 and 2.1 kg? Yes! Can it weigh between 2 and 2.01 kg? Yes! You can see that this line of questions could continue forever; thus, duck weight is a continuous variable. A quantitative variable is continuous if a possible value exists between every two values of the variable; otherwise, it is discrete. The two types of categorical variables are ordinal and nominal. Ordinal variables are categorical variables where a natural order or ranking exists among the categories. Nominal variables are categorical variables where no order or ranking exists among the categories. Ordinal and nominal variables are easily distinguished by determining if the order of the categories matters. For example, suppose that a researcher recorded a subjective measure of condition (i.e., poor, average, excellent) and the species of each duck. Order matters with the condition variable  i.e., condition improves from the first (poor) to the last category (excellent)  and some reorderings of the categories would not make sense  i.e., average, poor, excellent does not make sense. Thus, condition is an ordinal variable. In contrast, species (e.g., mallard, redhead, canvasback, and wood duck) is a nominal variable because there is no inherent order among the categories (i.e., any reordering of the categories also makes sense). Ordinal means that an order among the categories exists (note ord in both ordinal and order). The following are some issues to consider when identifying the type of a variable: The categories of a categorical variable are sometimes labeled with numbers. For example, 1=Poor, 3=Fair, and 5=Good. Dont let this fool you into calling the variable quantitative. Rankings, ratings, and preferences are ordinal (categorical) variables. Counts of numbers are discrete (quantitative) variables. Measurements are typically continuous (quantitative) variables. It does not matter how precisely quantitative variables are recorded when deciding if the variable is continuous or discrete. For example, the weight of the duck might have been recorded to the nearest kg. However, this was just a choice that was made, the actual values can be continuously finer than kg and, thus, weight is a continuous variable. Categorical variables that consist of only two levels or categories will be labeled as a nominal variable (because any order of the groups makes sense). This type of variable is also often called binomial. Do not confuse what type of variable (answer is one of continuous, discrete, nominal, or ordinal) with what type of variability (answer is natural or sampling) questions. What type of variable is ? is a different question than what type of variability is ? Be careful to note the word difference (i.e., variable versus variability) when answering these questions. The precision to which a quantitative variable was recorded does not determine whether it is continuous or discrete. How precisely the variable COULD have been recorded is the important consideration. Formal methods of inference are discussed beginning with Module ??. We will discuss how to compute and interpret each of these values in later modules. Again, parameters generally cannot be computed because all of the individuals in the population can not be seen. Thus, the parameter is largely conceptual. Note that this population and parameter cannot actually be calculated but it is what the researcher wants to know. Information about Hawk Ridge is found here. "],["DataProduction.html", "Module 3 Data Production 3.1 Experiments 3.2 Observational Studies  Sampling", " Module 3 Data Production Statistical inference is the process of making conclusions about a population from the results of a single sample. To make conclusions about the larger population, the sample must fairly represent the larger population. Thus, the proper collection (or production) of data is critical to statistics (and science in general). In this module, two ways of producing data  (1) Experiments and (2) Observational Studies  are described. Inferences cannot be made if data are not properly collected. 3.1 Experiments An experiment deliberately imposes a condition on individuals to observe the effect on the response variable. In a properly designed experiment, all variables that are not of interest are held constant, whereas the variable(s) that is (are) of interest are changed among treatments. As long as the experiment is designed properly (see below), differences among treatments are either due to the variable(s) that were deliberately changed or randomness (chance). Methods to determine if differences were likely due to randomness are developed in later modules. Because we can determine if differences most likely occurred o randomness or changes in the variales, strong cause-and-effect conclusions can be made from data collected from carefully designed experiments. 3.1.1 Single-factor Experiments A factor is a variable that is deliberately manipulated to determine its effect on the response variable. A factor is sometimes called an explanatory variable because we are attempting to determine how it affects (or explains) the response variable. The simplest experiment is a single-factor experiment where the individuals are split into groups defined by the categories of a single factor. For example, suppose that a researcher wants to examine the effect of temperature on the total number of bacterial cells after two weeks. They have inoculated 120 agars9 with the bacteria and placed them in a chamber where all environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, light) are controlled exactly. The researchers will use only two temperatures in this simple experiment  10oC and 15oC. All other variables are maintained at constant levels. Thus, temperature is the only factor in this simple experiement because it is the only variable manipulated to different values to determine its impact on the number of bacterial cells. In a single-factor experiment only one explanatory variable (i.e., factor) is allowed to vary; all other explanatory variables are held constant. Levels are the number of categories of the factor variable. In this example, there are two levels  10oC and 15oC. Treatments are the number of unique conditions that individuals in the experiment are exposed to. In a single-factor experiment, the number of treatments is the same as the number of levels of the single factor. Thus, in this simple experiment, there are two treatments  10oC and 15oC. Treatments are discussed more thoroughly in the next section. The number of replicates in an experiment is the number of individuals that will receive each treatment. In this example, a replicate is an inoculated agar. The number of replicates is the number of inoculated agars that will receive each of the two temperature treatments. The number of replicates is determined by dividing the total number of available individuals (120) by the number of treatments (2). Thus, in this example, the number of replicates is 60 inoculated agars. The agars used in this experiment will be randomly allocated to the two temperature treatments. All other variables  humidity, light, etc.  are kept the same for each treatment. At the end of two weeks, the total number of bacterial cells on each agar (i.e., the response variable) will be recorded and compared between the agars kept at both temperatures.10 Any difference in mean number of bacterial cells will be due to either different temperature treatments or randomness, because all other variables were the same between the two treatments. Differences among treatments are either caused by randomness (chance) or the factor. The single factor is not restricted to just two levels. For example, more than two temperatures, say 10oC, 12.5oC, 15oC, and 17.5oC, could have been tested. With this modification, there is still only one factor  temperature  but there are now four levels (and only four treatments). 3.1.2 Multi-factor Experiments  Design and Definitions More than one factor can be tested in an experiment. In fact, it is more efficient to have a properly designed experiment where more than one factor is varied at a time than it is to use separate experiments in which only one factor is varied in each. However, before showing this benefit, lets examine the definitions from the previous section in a multi-factor experiment. Suppose that the previous experiment was modified to also examine the effect of relative humidity on the number of bacteria cells. This modified experiment has two factors  temperature (with two levels of 10oC or 15oC) and relative humidity (with four levels of 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%). The number of treatments, or combinations of all factors, in this experiment is found by multiplying the levels of all factors (i.e., 2×4=8 in this case). The number of replicates in this experiment is now 15 (i.e., total number of available agars divided by the number of treatments; 120/8). The number of treatments is determined for the overall experiment, whereas the number of levels is determined for each factor. A drawing of the experimental design can be instructive (Table 3.1). The drawing is a table where the levels of one factor are shown in the rows of the first column and the levels of the other factor are shown in the rows of the second column such that each level of the first facor is matched with one of the levels of the second factor. With this, the number of rows in the table is the number of treatments in the experiment. I also like to include a column that lists the number of replicates in each treatment and the individual randomly allocated to each treatment (how to randomly allocate individuals to treatments is shown in the Allocating Individuals section below).

However, multi-factor experiments have many benefits, which can be illustrated by comparing a multi-factor experiment to separate single-factor experiments. For example, in addition to the two factor experiment in the previous section, consider separate single-factor experiments to determine the effect of each factor separately (further assume that individuals (i.e., agars) can be used in only one of these separate experiments). To conduct the two separate experiments, randomly split the 120 available agars into two equally-sized groups of 60. The first 60 will be split into two groups of 30 for the first experiment with two temperatures. The second 60 will be split into four groups of 15 for the second experiment with four relative humidities. These separate single-factor experiments are summarized in Table 3.2. Table 3.2: Diagram of two one-factor-at-a-time experiments with temperature (Top) and relative humidity (Bottom). Temp. # Reps Agars 10oC 30 79, 78, 14, 63, 41, 115, 107, 59, 35, 110 ,  15oC 30 39, 42, 82, 47, 101, 106, 29, 113, 2, 53 ,  Rel. Hum. # Reps Agars 20% 15 87, 70, 13, 111, 89, 85, 80, 83, 112, 86, 6, 19, 21, 84, 93 40% 15 12, 45, 66, 31, 30, 22, 90, 72, 7, 120, 27, 50, 23, 71, 69 60% 15 25, 103, 109, 94, 15, 55, 58, 61, 60, 56, 11, 57, 73, 44, 119 80% 15 104, 68, 20, 51, 24, 5, 114, 4, 28, 118, 105, 76, 9, 3, 49 The key to examining the benefits of the multi-factor experiment is to determine the number of individuals that give information about (i.e., are exposed to) each factor. In the two-factor experiment all 120 individuals were exposed to one of the temperature levels with 60 individuals exposed to each level (Table 3.1). In contrast, only 30 individuals were exposed to these levels in the single-factor experiment (Table 3.2-Top). In addition, in the two-factor experiment all 120 individuals were exposed to one of the relative humidity levels with 30 individuals exposed to each level (Table 3.1). Again, this is in contrast to the single-factor experiment where only 15 individuals were exposed to these levels (Table 3.2-Bottom). Thus, the first advantage of multi-factor experiments is that the available individuals are used more efficiently. In other words, more information (i.e., the responses of more individuals) is obtained from a multi-factor experiment than from combinations of single-factor experiments.11 A properly designed multi-factor experiment also allows researchers to determine if multiple factors interact to impact an individuals response. For example, consider the hypothetical results from this experiment in Figure 3.1-Left.12 The effect of relative humidity is to increase the growth rate for those individuals at 10oC (black line) but to decrease the growth rate for those individuals at 15oC (blue line). That is, the effect of relative humidity differs depending on the level of temperature. When the effect of one factor differs depending on the level of the other factor, then the two factors are said to interact. Interactions cannot be determined from the two single-factor experiments because the same individuals are not exposed to levels of the two factors at the same time. Figure 3.1: Mean growth rates in a two-factor experiment that depict an interaction effect (left) and no interaction effect (right). Multi-factor experiments are used to detect the presence or absence of interaction, not just the presence of it. The hypothetical results in Figure 3.1-Right show that the growth rate increases with increasing relative humidity at about the same rate for both temperatures. Thus, because the effect of relative humidity is the same for each temperature (and vice versa), there does not appear to be an interaction between the two factors. Again, this could not be determined from the separate single-factor experiments. 3.1.4 Allocating Individuals Individuals13 should be randomly allocated (i.e., placed into) to treatments. Randomization will tend to even out differences among groups for variables not considered in the experiment. In other words, randomization should help assure that all groups are similar before the treatments are imposed. Thus, randomly allocating individuals to treatments removes any bias (foreseen or unforeseen) from entering the experiment. In the single-factor experiment above  two treatments of temperature  there were 120 agars. To randomly allocate these individuals to the treatments, 60 pieces of paper marked with 10 and 60 marked with 15 could be placed into a hat. One piece of paper would be drawn for each agar and the agar would receive the temperature found on the piece of paper. Alternatively, each agar could be assigned a unique number between 1 and 120 and pieces of paper with these numbers could be placed into the hat. Agars corresponding to the first 60 numbers drawn from the hat could then be placed into the first treatment. Agars for the next (or remaining) 60 numbers would be placed in the second treatment. This process is essentially the same as randomly ordering 120 numbers. A random order of numbers is obtained with R by including the count of numbers as the only argument to sample(). For example, randomly ordering 1 through 120 is accomplished with sample(120) #R&gt; [1] 79 78 14 63 41 115 107 59 35 110 8 46 64 99 37 38 81 48 #R&gt; [19] 74 36 77 95 65 91 26 98 1 97 108 62 39 42 82 47 101 106 #R&gt; [37] 29 113 2 53 18 32 52 34 117 100 43 75 116 67 54 10 102 16 #R&gt; [55] 92 88 40 17 96 33 87 70 13 111 89 85 80 83 112 86 6 19 #R&gt; [73] 21 84 93 12 45 66 31 30 22 90 72 7 120 27 50 23 71 69 #R&gt; [91] 25 103 109 94 15 55 58 61 60 56 11 57 73 44 119 104 68 20 #R&gt; [109] 51 24 5 114 4 28 118 105 76 9 3 49 Thus, the first five (of 60) agars in the 10oC treatment are 79, 78, 14, 63, and 41 (Table 3.2-Top). The first five (of 60) agars in the 15oC treatment are 87, 70, 13, 111, and 89 (Table 3.2-Top). In the modified experiment with two factors  temperature and relative humidity  with eight treatments containing 15 agars each, the random numbers would be divided into 8 groups each with 15 numbers. The allocation of individuals was shown in Table 3.1. Individuals should be randomly allocated to treatments to remove bias. 3.1.5 Design Principles There are many other methods of designing experiments and allocating individuals that are beyond the scope of this book.14 However, all experimental designs contain the following three basic principles. Control the effect of variables on the response variable by deliberately manipulating factors to certain levels and maintaining constancy among other variables. Randomize the allocation of individuals to treatments to eliminate bias. Replicate individuals (use many individuals) in the experiment to reduce chance variation in the results. Proper control in an experiment allows for strong cause-and-effect conclusions to be made (i.e., to state that an observed difference in the response variable was due to the levels of the factor or chance variation rather than some other foreseen or unforeseen variable). Randomly allocating individuals to treatments removes any bias that may be included in the experiment. For example, if we do not randomly allocate the agars to the treatments, then it is possible that a set of all poor agars may end up in one treatment. In this case, any observed differences in the response may not be due to the levels of the factor but to the prior quality of the agars. Replication means that there should be more than one or a few individuals in each treatment. This reduces the effect of each individual on the overall results. For example, if there was one agar in each treatment, then, even with random allocation, the effect of that treatment may be due to some inherent properties of that agar rather than the levels of the factors. Replication, along with randomization, helps assure that the groups of individuals in each treatment are as alike as possible at the start of the experiment. 3.2 Observational Studies  Sampling In observational studies the researcher has no control over any of the variables observed for an individual. The researcher simply observes individuals, disturbing them as little as possible, trying to get a picture of the population. Observational studies cannot be used to make cause-and-effect statements because all variables that may impact the outcome may not have been measured or specifically controlled. Thus, any observed difference among groups may be caused by the variables measured, some other unmeasured variables, or chance (randomness). Consider the following as an example of the problems that can occur when all variables are not measured. For many years scientists thought that the brains of females weighed less than the brains of males. They used this finding to support all kinds of ideas about sex-based differences in learning ability. However, these earlier researchers failed to measure body weight, which is strongly related to brain weight in both males and females. After controlling for the effect of differences in body weights, there was no difference in brain weights between the sexes. Thus, many sexist ideas persisted for years because cause-and-effect statements were inferred from data where all variables were not considered. Strong cause-and-effect statements CANNOT be made from observational studies. In observational studies, it is important to understand to which population inferences will refer.15 To make useful inferences from a sample, the sample must be an unbiased representation of the population. In other words, it must not systematically favor certain individuals or outcomes. For example, consider that you want to determine the mean length of all fish in a particular lake (e.g., Square Lake from Module 2). Using a net with large mesh, such that only large fish are caught, would produce a biased sample because interest is in all fish not just the large fish. Setting the nets near spawning beds (i.e., only adult fish) would also produce a biased sample. In both instances, a sample would be collected from a population other than the population of interest. Thus it is important to select a sample from the specified population. It is important to understand the population before considering how to take a sample. 3.2.1 Types of Sampling Designs Three common types of sampling designs  voluntary response, convenience, and probability-based samples  are considered in this section. Voluntary response and convenience samples tend to produce biased samples, whereas proper probability-based samples will produce an unbiased sample. A voluntary response sample consists of individuals that have chosen themselves for the sample by responding to a general appeal. An example of a voluntary response sample would be the group of people that respond to a general appeal placed in the school newspaper. If the population of interest in this sample was all students at the school, then this type of general appeal would likely produce a biased sample of students that (i) read the school newspaper, (ii) feel strongly about the topic, or (iii) both. A convenience sample consists of individuals who are easiest to reach for the researcher. An example of a convenience sample is when a researcher queries only those students in a particular class. This sample is convenient because the individuals are easy to gather. However, if the population of interest was all students at the school, then this type of sample would likely produce a biased sample of students that is likely of (i) one major or another, (ii) one or a few years-in-school (e.g., Freshman or Sophomores), or (iii) both. In probability-based sampling, each individual of the population has a known chance of being selected for the sample. The simplest probability-based sample is the Simple Random Sample (SRS) where each individual has the same chance of being selected. Proper selection of an SRS requires each individual to be assigned a unique number. The SRS is then formed by choosing random numbers and collecting the individuals that correspond to those numbers. For example, an auditor may need to select a sample of 30 financial transactions from all transactions of a particular bank during the previous month. Because each transaction is numbered, the auditor may know that there were 1112 transactions during the previous month (i.e., the population). The auditor would then number each transaction from 1 to 1112, randomly select 30 numbers (with no repeats) from between 1 and 1112, and then physically locate the 30 transactions that correspond to the 30 selected numbers. Those 30 transactions are the SRS. Random numbers are selected in R by including the population size as the first and sample size as the second argument to sample(). For example, 30 numbers from between 1 and 1112 is selected with sample(1112,30) #R&gt; [1] 684 986 155 638 10 390 381 265 474 707 699 97 752 681 565 #R&gt; [16] 739 59 324 861 637 490 911 446 406 846 516 269 1052 384 1105 Thus, accounts 684, 986, 155, 638, and 10 would be the first five (of 30) selected. There are other more complex types of probability-based samples that are beyond the scope of this course.16 However, the goal of these more complex types of samples is generally to impart more control into the sampling design. A proper SRS requires each individual i the population to be assigned a unique number. If the population is such that a number cannot be assigned to each individual, then the researcher must try to use a method for which they feel each individual has an equal chance of being selected. Usually this means randomizing the technique rather than the individuals. In the fish example discussed on the previous page, the researcher may consider choosing random mesh sizes, random locations for placing the net, or random times for placing the net. Thus, in many real-life instances, the researcher simply tries to use a method that is likely to produce an SRS or something very close to it. If a number cannot be assigned to each individual in the population, then the researcher should randomize the technique to assure as close to a random sample as possible. Polls, campaign or otherwise, are examples of observational studies that you are probably familiar with. The following are links where various aspects of polling are discussed. How Polls are Conducted by Frank Newport, Lydia Saad, and David Moore, The Gallup Organization. Why Do Campaign Polls Zigzag So Much? by G.S. Wasserman, Purdue U. 3.2.2 Of What Value are Observational Studies? Properly designed experiments can lead to cause-and-effect statements, whereas observational studies (even properly designed) are unlikely to lead to such statements. Furthermore, in the last section, it was suggested that it is very difficult to take a proper probability-based sample because it is hard to assign a number to each individual in the population (precisely because entire populations are very difficult to see). So, do observational studies have any value? There are at least three reasons why observational studies are useful. The scientific method begins with making an observation about a natural phenomenon. Observational studies may serve to provide such an observation. Alternatively, observational studies may be deployed after an observation has been made to see if that observation is prevalent and worthy of further investigation. Thus, observational studies may lead directly to hypotheses that form the basis of experiments. Experiments are often conducted under very confined and controlled conditions so that the effect of one or more factors on the response variable can be identified. However, at the conclusion of an experiment it is often questioned whether a similar response would be observed in nature under much less controlled conditions. For example, one might determine that a certain fertilizer increases growth of a certain plant in the greenhouse, with consistent soil characteristics, temperatures, lighting, etc. However, it is a much different, and, perhaps, more interesting, question to determine if that fertilizer elicits the same response when applied to an actual field. Finally, there are situations where conducting an experiment simply cannot be done, either for ethical, financial, size, or other constraints. For example, it is generally accepted that smoking causes cancer in humans even though an experiment where one group of people was forced to smoke while another was not allowed to smoke has not been conducted. Similarly, it is also very difficult to perform valid experiments on ecosystems. In these situations, an observational study is simply the best study allowable. Cause-and-effect statements are arrived at in these situations because observational studies can be conducted with some, though not absolute, control and control can be imparted mathematically into some analyses.17 In addition, a preponderance of evidence may be arrived at if enough observational studies point to the same conclusion. An agar, in this case, is a petri dish with a growth medium for the bacteria. Methods for making this comparison are in Module ??. The real importance of this advantage will become apparent when statistical power is introduced in Module ??. The means of each treatment are plotted and connected with lines in this plot. When discussing experiments, an individual is often referred to as a replicate or an experimental unit. Other common designs include blocked, Latin square, and nested designs. Thus, it is very important to first perform an IVPPS as discussed in Module 2. For example, stratified samples, nested, and multistage samples. These analyses are beyond the scope of this book, though. "],["UnivSum.html", "Module 4 Univariate Summaries 4.1 Quantitative Variable 4.2 Categorical Variable", " Module 4 Univariate Summaries Summarizing large quantities of data with few graphical or numerical summaries makes it is easier to identify meaning from data (discussed in Module 1). Numeric and graphical summaries specific to a single variable are described in this module. Interpretations from these numeric and graphical summaries are described in the next module. 4.1 Quantitative Variable Two data sets will be considered in this section about summarizing quantitative variables. The first data set consists of the number of open pit mines in countries with open pit mines (Table 4.1).18 The second data set is Richter scale recordings for 15 major earthquakes (Table 4.2). Table 4.1: Number of open pit mines in countries that have open pit mines. 2 11 4 1 15 12 1 1 3 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 4 1 4 2 4 2 1 4 11 1 Table 4.2: Richter scale recordings for 15 major earthquakes. 5.5 6.3 6.5 6.5 6.8 6.8 6.9 7.1 7.3 7.3 7.7 7.7 7.7 7.8 8.1 4.1.1 Numerical Summaries A typical value and the variability of a quantitative variable are often described from numerical summaries. Calculation of these summaries is described in this module, whereas their interpretation is described in Module 5. As you will see in Module 5, typical values are measures of center and variability is often described as dispersion (or spread). Three measures of center are the median, mean, and mode. Three measures of dispersion are the inter-quartile range, standard deviation, and range. All measures computed in this module are summary statistics  i.e., they are computed from individuals in a sample. Thus, the name of each measure should be preceded by sample  e.g., sample median, sample mean, and sample standard deviation. These measures could be computed from every individual, if the population was known. The values would then be parameters and would be preceded by population  e.g., population median, population mean, and population standard deviation.19 4.1.1.1 Median The median is the value of the individual in the position that splits the ordered list of individuals into two equal-sized halves. In other words, if the data are ordered, half the values will be smaller than the median and half will be larger. The process for finding the median consists of three steps,20 Order the data from smallest to largest. Find the middle position (\\(mp\\)) with \\(mp=\\frac{n+1}{2}\\). If \\(mp\\) is an integer (i.e., no decimal), then the median is the value of the individual in that position. If \\(mp\\) is not an integer, then the median is the average of the value immediately below and the value immediately above the \\(mp\\). As an example, the open pit data from Table 4.1 are shown below. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 4 4 4 4 4 11 11 12 15 Because \\(n=26\\), the \\(mp=\\frac{26+1}{2}=13.5\\). The \\(mp\\) is not an integer so the median is the average of the values in the 13th and 14th ordered positions (i.e., the two positions closest to \\(mp\\)). Thus, the median number of open pit mines in this sample of countries is \\(\\frac{2+2}{2}=2\\). Consider finding the median of the Richter Scale magnitude recorded for fifteen major earthquakes as another example (ordered data are in Table 4.2). Because \\(n=15\\), the \\(mp=\\frac{15+1}{2}=8\\). The \\(mp\\) is an integer so the median is the value of the individual in the 8th ordered position, which is 7.1. Dont forget to order the data when computing the median. 4.1.1.2 Inter-Quartile Range Quartiles are the values for the three individuals that divide ordered data into four (approximately) equal parts. Finding the three quartiles consists of finding the median, splitting the data into two equal parts at the median, and then finding the medians of the two halves.21 A concern in this process is that the median is NOT part of either half if there is an odd number of individuals. These steps are summarized as, Order the data from smallest to largest. Find the median  this is the second quartile (Q2). Split the data into two halves at the median. If \\(n\\) is odd (so that the median is one of the observed values), then the median is not part of either half.22 Find the median of the lower half of data  this is the 1st quartile (Q1). Find the median of the upper half of data  this is the third quartile (Q3). These calculations are illustrated with the open pit mine data (the median was computed in Section 4.1.1.1). Because \\(n=26\\) is even, the halves of the data split naturally into two halves each with 13 individuals. Therefore, the \\(mp=\\frac{13+1}{2}=7\\) and the median of each half is the value of the individual in the seventh position. Thus, \\(Q1=1\\) and \\(Q3=4\\). 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 4 4 4 4 4 11 11 12 15 In summary, the first, second, and third quartiles for the open pit mine data are 1, 2, and 4, respectively. These three values separate the ordered individuals into approximately four equally-sized groups  those with values less than (or equal to) 1, with values between (inclusive) 1 and 2, with values between (inclusive) 2 and 4, and with values greater (or equal to) than 4. As another example, consider finding the quartiles for the earthquake data (Table 4.2). Recall from Section 4.1.1.1 that the median (=7.1) is in the eighth position of the ordered data. The value in the eighth position will NOT be included in either half. Thus, the two halves of the data are 5.5, 6.3, 6.5, 6.5, 6.8, 6.8, 6.9 and 7.3, 7.3, 7.7, 7.7, 7.7, 7.8, 8.1. The middle position for each half is then \\(mp=\\frac{7+1}{2}=4\\). Thus, the median for each half is the individual in the fourth position. Therefore, the median of the first half is \\(Q1=6.5\\) and the median of the second half is \\(Q3=7.7\\). The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between \\(Q3\\) and \\(Q1\\), namely \\(Q3-Q1\\). However, the IQR (as strictly defined) suffers from a lack of information. For example, what does an IQR of 9 mean? It can have a completely different interpretation if the IQR is from values of 1 to 10 or if it is from values of 1000 to 1009. Thus, the IQR is more useful if presented as both \\(Q3\\) and \\(Q1\\), rather than as the difference. Thus, for example, the IQR for the open pit mine data is from a \\(Q1\\) of 1 to a \\(Q3\\) of 4 and the IQR for the earthquake data is from a \\(Q1\\) of 6.5 to a \\(Q3\\) of 7. The IQR can be thought of as the range of the middle half of the data. When reporting the IQR, explicitly state both \\(Q1\\) and \\(Q3\\) (i.e., do not subtract them). 4.1.1.3 Mean The mean is the arithmetic average of the data. The sample mean is denoted by \\(\\bar{x}\\) and the population mean by \\(\\mu\\). The mean is simply computed by adding up all of the values and dividing by the number of individuals. If the measurement of the generic variable \\(x\\) on the \\(i\\)th individual is denoted as \\(x_{i}\\), then the sample mean is computed with these two steps, Sum (i.e., add together) all of the values  \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\\). Divide by the number of individuals in the sample  \\(n\\). or more succinctly summarized with this equation, \\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}{n} \\] For example, the sample mean of the open pit mine data is computed as follows: \\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac{2+11+4+1+15+ ... +2+1+4+11+1}{26} = \\frac{94}{26} = 3.6 \\] Note in this example with a discrete variable that it is possible (and reasonable) to present the mean with a decimal. For example, it is not possible for a country to have 3.6 open pit mines, but it IS possible for the mean of a sample of countries to be 3.6 open pit mines. As a general rule-of-thumb, present the mean with one more decimal than the number of decimals it was recorded in. 4.1.1.4 Standard Deviation The sample standard deviation, denoted by \\(s\\), is computed with these six steps: Compute the sample mean (i.e., \\(\\bar{x}\\)). For each value (\\(x_{i}\\)), find the difference between the value and the mean (i.e., \\(x_{i}-\\bar{x}\\)). Square each difference (i.e., \\((x_{i}-\\bar{x})^{2}\\)). Add together all the squared differences. Divide this sum by \\(n-1\\). [*Stopping here gives the sample variance, \\(s^{2}\\).}] Square root the result from the previous step to get \\(s\\). These steps are neatly summarized with \\[ s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\\bar{x})^{2}}{n-1}} \\] The calculation of the standard deviation of the earthquake data is facilitated with the calculations shown in Table 4.3. In Table 4.3, note that \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sum of the Value column divided by \\(n=15\\) (i.e., \\(\\bar{x}=7.07\\)). The Diff column is each observed value minus \\(\\bar{x}\\) (i.e., Step 2). The Diff\\(^2\\) column is the square of the differences (i.e., Step 3). The sum of the Diff\\(^2\\) column is Step 4. The sample variance (i.e., Step 5) is equal to this sum divided by \\(n-1=14\\) or \\(\\frac{6.773}{14}=0.484\\). The sample standard deviation is the square root of the sample variance or \\(s=\\sqrt{0.484}=0.696\\). Table 4.3: Table showing an efficient calculation of the standard deviation of the earthquake data. Indiv Value Diff Diff2 1 5.5 -1.57 2.454 2 6.3 -0.77 0.588 3 6.5 -0.57 0.321 4 6.5 -0.57 0.321 5 6.8 -0.27 0.071 6 6.8 -0.27 0.071 7 6.9 -0.17 0.028 8 7.1 0.03 0.001 9 7.3 0.23 0.054 10 7.3 0.23 0.054 11 7.7 0.63 0.401 12 7.7 0.63 0.401 13 7.7 0.63 0.401 14 7.8 0.73 0.538 15 8.1 1.03 1.068 From this, on average, each earthquake is approximately 0.70 Richter Scale units different than the average earthquake in these data. In the standard deviation calculations dont forget to take the square root of the variance. The standard deviation is greater than or equal to zero. The standard deviation can be thought of as the average difference between the values and the mean. This is, however, not a strict definition because the formula for the standard deviation does not simply add the differences and divide by \\(n\\) as this definition would imply. Notice in Table 4.3 that the sum of the differences from the mean is 0. This will be the case for all standard deviation calculations using the correct mean, because the mean balances the distance to individuals below the mean with the distance of individuals above the mean (see Section 5.1.3). Thus, the mean difference will always be zero. This problem is corrected by squaring the differences before summing them. To get back to the original units, the squaring is later reversed by the square root. So, more accurately, the standard deviation is the square root of the average squared differences between the values and the mean. Therefore, the average difference between the values and the mean works as a practical definition of the meaning of the standard deviation, but it is not strictly correct. Use the fact that the sum of all differences from the mean equals zero as a check of your standard deviation calculation. Further note that the mean is the value that minimizes the value of the standard deviation calculation  i.e., putting any other value besides the mean into the standard deviation equation will result in a larger value. Finally, you may be wondering why the sum of the squared differences in the standard deviation calculation is divided by \\(n-1\\), rather than \\(n\\). Recall (from Section 2.1) that statistics are meant to estimate parameters. The sample standard deviation is supposed to estimate the population standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)). Theorists have shown that if we divide by \\(n\\), \\(s\\) will consistently underestimate \\(\\sigma\\). Thus, \\(s\\) calculated in this way would be a biased estimator of \\(\\sigma\\). Theorists have found, though, that dividing by \\(n-1\\) will cause \\(s\\) to be an unbiased estimator of \\(\\sigma\\). Being unbiased is generally good  it means that on average our statistic estimates our parameter (this concept is discussed in more detail in Module 11). 4.1.1.5 Mode The mode is the value that occurs most often in a data set. For example, one open pit mine is the mode in the open pit mine data (Table 4.4). Table 4.4: Frequency of countries by each number of open pit mines. Number of Mines 1 2 3 4 11 12 15 Freq of Countries 10 6 1 5 2 1 1 The mode for a continuous variable is the class or bin with the highest frequency of individuals. For example, if 0.5-unit class widths are used in the Richter scale data, then the modal class is 6.5-6.9 (Table 4.5). Table 4.5: Frequency of earthquakes by Richter Scale class. Richter Scale Class 5.5-5.9 6-6.4 6.5-6.9 7-7.4 7.5-7.9 8-8.4 Freq of Earthquakes 1 1 5 3 4 1 Some data sets may have two values or classes with the maximum frequency. In these situations the variable is said to be bimodal. 4.1.1.6 Range The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the data and measures the ultimate dispersion or spread of the data. The range in the open pit mine data is 15-1 = 14. The range should never be used by itself as a measure of dispersion. The range is extremely sensitive to outliers and is best used only to show all possible values present in the data. The range (as strictly defined) also suffers from a lack of information. For example, what does a range of 9 mean? It can have a completely different interpretation if it came from values of 1 to 10 or if it came from values of 1000 to 1009. Thus, the range is more instructive if presented as both the maximum and minimum value rather than the difference. 4.1.2 Graphical Summaries 4.1.2.1 Histogram A histogram plots the frequency of individuals (y-axis) in classes of values of the quantitative variable (x-axis). Construction of a histogram begins by creating classes of values for the variable of interest. The easiest way to create a list of classes is to divide the range (i.e., maximum minus minimum value) by a nice number near eight to ten, and then round up to make classes that are easy to work with. The nice number between eight and ten is chosen to make the division easy and will be the number of classes. For example, the range of values in the open pit mine example is 15-1 = 14. A nice value near eight and ten to divide this range by is seven. Thus, the classes should be two units wide (=14/7) and, for ease, will begin at 0 (Table 4.6). Table 4.6: Frequency table of number of countries in two-mine-wide classes. Class 0-1 2-3 4-5 6-7 8-9 10-11 12-13 14-15 Frequency 10 7 5 0 0 2 1 1 The frequency of individuals in each class is then counted (shown in the second row of Table 4.6). The plot is prepared with values of the classes forming the x-axis and frequencies forming the y-axis (Figure 4.1-A). The first bar added to this skeleton plot has the bottom-left corner at 0 and the bottom-right corner at 2 on the x-axis, and a height equal to the frequency of individuals in the 0-1 class (Figure 4.1-B). A second bar is then added with the bottom-left corner at 2 and the bottom-right corner at 4 on the x-axis, and a height equal to the frequency of individuals in the 2-3 class (Figure 4.1-C). This process is continued with the remaining classes until the full histogram is constructed (Figure 4.1D). Figure 4.1: Steps (described in text) illustrating the construction of a histogram. Ideally eight to ten classes are used in a histogram. Too many or too few bars make it difficult to identify the shape and may lead to different interpretations. A dramatic example of the effect of changing the number of classes is seen in histograms of the length of eruptions for the Old Faithful geyser (Figure 4.2). Figure 4.2: Histogram of length of eruptions for Old Faithful geyser with varying number of bins/classes. 4.1.2.2 Boxplot The five-number summary consists of the minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum values (effectively contains the range, IQR, and median). For example, the five-number summary for the open pit mine data is 1, 1, 2, 4, and 15 (all values computed in the previous sections). The five-number summary may be displayed as a boxplot. A traditional boxplot (Figure 4.3-Left) consists of a horizontal line at the median, horizontal lines at Q1 and Q3 that are connected with vertical lines to form a box, and vertical lines from Q1 to the minimum and from Q3 to the maximum. In modern boxplots (Figure 4.3-Right) the upper line extends from Q3 to the last observed value that is within 1.5 IQRs of Q3 and the lower line extends from Q1 to the last observed value that is within 1.5 IQRs of Q1. Observed values outside of the whiskers are termed outliers by this algorithm and are typically plotted with circles or asterisks. If no individuals are deemed outliers by this algorithm, then the traditional and modern boxplots will be the same. Figure 4.3: Traditional (Left) and modern (Right) boxplots of the open pit mine data. 4.2 Categorical Variable In this section, methods to construct tables and graphs for categorical data are described. Interpretation of the results is demonstrated in the next module. The concepts are illustrated with data about MTH107 students from the Winter 2020 semester. Specifically, whether or not a student was required to take the courses and the students year-in-school will be summarized. Whether or not a student was required to take the course for a subset of individuals is shown in Table 4.7. Table 4.7: Whether (Y) or not (N) MTH107 was required for eight individuals in MTH107 in Winter 2020. Individual Required 1 Y 2 N 3 N 4 Y 5 Y 6 Y 7 N 8 Y 4.2.1 Numerical Summaries 4.2.1.1 Frequency and Percentage Tables A simple method to summarize categorical data is to count the number of individuals in each level of the categorical variable. These counts are called frequencies and the resulting table (Table 4.8) is called a frequency table. From this table, it is seen that there were five students that were required and three that were not required to take MTH107. Table 4.8: Frequency table for whether MTH107 was required (Y) or not (N) for eight individuals in MTH107 in Winter 2020. Required Frequency N 3 Y 5 The remainder of this module will use results from the entire class rather than the subset used above. For example, frequency tables of individuals by sex and year-in-school for the entire class are in Table 4.9. Table 4.9: Frequency tables for whether (Y) or not (N) MTH107 was required (Left) and year-in-school (Right) for all individuals in MTH107 in Winter 2020. Required Frequency Year Frequency N 30 Fr 19 Y 38 So 12 Jr 29 Sr 9 Frequency tables are often modified to show the percentage of individuals in each level. Percentage tables are constructed from frequency tables by dividing the number of individuals in each level by the total number of individuals examined (\\(n\\)) and then multiplying by 100. For example, the percentage tables for both whether or not MTH107 was required and year-in-school (Table 4.10) for students in MTH107 is constructed from Table 4.9 by dividing the value in each cell by 68, the total number of students in the class, and then multiplying by 100. From this it is seen that 55.9% of students were required to take the course and 13.0% were seniors (Table 4.10). Table 4.10: Percentage tables for whether (Y) or not (N) MTH107 was required (Left) and year-in-school (Right) for all individuals in MTH107 in Winter 2020. Required Percentage Year Percentage N 44.1 Fr 27.5 Y 55.9 So 17.4 Jr 42.0 Sr 13.0 4.2.2 Graphical Summaries 4.2.2.1 Bar Charts Bar charts are used to display the frequency or percentage of individuals in each level of a categorical variable. Bar charts look similar to histograms in that they have the frequency of individuals on the y-axis. However, category labels rather than quantitative values are plotted on the x-axis. In addition, to highlight the categorical nature of the data, bars on a bar chart do not touch. A bar chart for whether or not individuals were required to take MTH107 is in Figure 4.4-Left. This bar chart does not add much to the frequency table because there were only two categories. However, bar charts make it easier to compare the number of individuals in each of several categories as in Figure 4.4-Right. Figure 4.4: Bar charts of the frequency of individuals in MTH107 during Winter 2010 by whether or not they were required to take MTH107 (Left) and year-in-school (Right). Bar charts are used to display the frequency of individuals in the categories of a categorical variable. Histograms are used to display the frequency of individuals in classes created from quantitative variables. These data were collected from this page. See Section 2.1 for clarification on the differences between populations and samples and parameters and statistics. Most computer programs use a more sophisticated algorithm for computing the median and, thus, will produce different results than what will result from applying these steps. You should review how a median is computed before proceeding with this section. Some authors put the median into both halves when \\(n\\) is odd. The difference between the two methods is minimal for large \\(n\\). "],["UnivEDA.html", "Module 5 Univariate EDA 5.1 Quantitative Variable 5.2 Categorical Variable", " Module 5 Univariate EDA 5.1 Quantitative Variable A univariate EDA for a quantitative variable is concerned with describing the distribution of values for that variable; i.e., describing what values occurred and how often those values occurred. Specifically, the distribution is described with these four attributes: shape of the distribution, presence of outliers, center of the distribution, and dispersion or spread of the distribution. Graphs are used to identify shape and the presence of outliers and to get a general feel for center and dispersion. Numerical summaries, however, are used to specifically describe center and dispersion of the variable. Computing and constructing the required numerical and graphical summaries was described in Module 4. Those summaries are interpreted here to provide an overall description of the distribution of the quantitative variable. The same three data sets used in Module 4 are used here. Number of open pit mines in countries with open pit mines (Table 4.1). Richter scale recordings for 15 major earthquakes (Table 4.2). The number of days of ice cover at ice gauge station 9004 in Lake Superior. 5.1.1 Interpreting Shape A distribution has two tails  a left-tail of smaller or more negative values and a right-tail of larger or more positive values (Figure 5.1). The relative appearance of the tails is used to identify the shape of a distribution. If the left- and right-tail are approximately equal in length and height, then the distribution is symmetric (or more specifically approximately symmetric). If the left-tail is stretched out or is longer and flatter than the right-tail, then the distribution is negatively- or left-skewed. If the right-tail is stretched out or is longer and flatter than the left-tail, then the distribution is positively- or right-skewed. Figure 5.1: Examples of left-skewed, approximately symmetric, and right-skewed histograms. The skewed distributions are more skewed in the top row and less skewed in the bottom row. The longer tail defines the type of skew; a longer right-tail means the distribution is right-skewed and a longer left-tail means it is left-skewed. In practice, these labels form a continuum (Figure 5.1). For example, it may be difficult to discern whether the shape is approximately symmetric or skew. To partially address this issue, slightly or strongly may be used with skewed to distinguish whether the distribution is obviously skewed (i.e., strongly skewed) or nearly symmetric (i.e., slightly skewed). Shape terms may be modified with approximately, slightly, or strongly. A distribution is bimodal if there are two distinct peaks (Figure 5.2). The shape may be bimodal left-skewed if the left peak is shorter, bimodal symmetric if the two peaks are the same height, or bimodal right-skewed if the right peak is shorter. Figure 5.2: Example of a bimodal left-skewed histograms. Shape may be identified from a histogram or a boxplot (Figure 5.3). Shape is most easily determined from a histogram, as you can focus simply on the longest tail. With boxplots, one must examine the relative length from the median to Q1 and the median to Q3 (i.e., the position of the median line in the box). If the distribution is left-skewed (i.e., lesser-valued individuals are spread out), then the median-Q1 will be greater than Q3-median. In contrast, if the distribution is right-skewed (i.e., larger-valued individuals are spread out), then the Q3-median will be greater than median-Q1. Thus, the median is nearer the top of the box for a left-skewed distribution, nearer the bottom of the box for a right-skewed distribution, and nearer the center of the box for a symmetric distribution (Figure 5.3). Figure 5.3: Histograms and boxplots for several different shapes of distributions. Shape is easier to describe from a histogram than a boxplot. 5.1.2 Interpreting Outliers An outlier is an individual whose value is widely separated from the main cluster of values in the sample. On histograms, outliers appear as bars that are separated from the main cluster of bars by white space or areas with no bars (Figure 5.4). In general, outliers must be on the margins of the histogram, should be separated by one or two missing bars, and should only be one or two individuals. Figure 5.4: Example histogram with an outlier to the right (dark gray). An outlier may be a result of human error in the sampling process and, thus, it should be corrected or removed. Other times an outlier may be an individual that was not part of the population of interest  e.g., an adult animal that was sampled when only immature animals were being considered  and, thus, it should be removed from the sample. Still other times, an outlier is part of the population and should generally not be removed from the sample. In fact you may wish to highlight an outlier as an interesting observation! Regardless, it is important to construct a histogram to determine if outliers are present or not. Dont let outliers completely influence how you define the shape of a distribution. For example, if the main cluster of values is approximately symmetric and there is one outlier to the right of the main cluster (as illustrated in Figure 5.4), DONT call the distribution right-skewed. You should describe this distribution as approximately symmetric with an outlier to the right. Not all outliers warrant removal from your sample. Dont let outliers completely influence how you define the shape of a distribution. 5.1.3 Comparing the Median and Mean As mentioned previously, numerical measures will be used to describe the center and dispersion of a distribution. However, which values should be used? Should one use the mean or the median as a measure of center? Should one use the IQR or the standard deviation as a measure of dispersion? Which measures are used depends on how the measures respond to skew and the presence of outliers. Thus, before stating a rule for which measures should be used, a fundamental difference among the measures discussed in Module 4 is explored here. The following discussion is focused on comparing the mean and the median. However, note that the IQR is fundamentally linked to the median (i.e., to find the IQR, the median must first be found) and the standard deviation is fundamentally linked to the mean (i.e., to find the standard deviation, the mean must first be found). Thus, the median and IQR will always be used together to measure center and dispersion, as will the mean and standard deviation. The mean and median measure center differently. The median balances the number of individuals smaller and larger than it. The mean, on the other hand, balances the sum of the distances to all points smaller than it and the sum of the distances to all points greater than it. Thus, the median is primarily concerned with the position of the value rather than the value itself, whereas the mean is concerned with the values for each individual (i.e., the values are used to find the distance from the mean). The actual values of the data (beyond ordering data) are not considered when calculating the median; whereas the actual values are considered when calculating the mean. A plot of the Richter scale data against the corresponding ordered individual numbers is shown in Figure 5.5-Top. The median (blue line) is the Richter scale value that corresponds to the middle individual number (i.e., move right from the individual number until the point is intercepted and then move down to the x-axis). Thus, the median (blue line) has the same number of individuals (i.e., points) above and below it. In contrast, the mean finds the Richter scale value that has the same total distance to values below it as total distance to values above it. In other words, the mean (vertical red line) is placed such that the total length of the horizontal dashed red lines (distances from mean to point) is the same to the left as to the right. Figure 5.5: Plot of the individual number versus Richter scale values for the original earthquake data (Top) and the earthquake data with an extreme outlier (Bottom). The median value is shown as a blue vertical line and the mean value is shown as a red vertical line. Differences between each individual value and the mean value are shown with horizontal red lines. The mean balances the distance to individuals above and below the mean. The median balances the number of individuals above and below the median. The sum of all differences between individual values and the mean equals zero. The mean and median differ in their sensitivity to outliers (Figure 5.5). For example, suppose that an incredible earthquake with a Richter Scale value of 19.0 was added to the earthquake data set. With this additional individual, the median increases from 7.1 to 7.2, but the mean increases from 7.1 to 7.8. The outlier impacts the value of the mean more than the value of the median because of the way that each statistic measures center. The mean will be pulled towards an outlier because it must put many values on the side of the mean away from the outlier so that the sum of the differences to the larger values and the sum of the differences to the smaller values will be equal. In this example, the outlier creates a large difference to the right of the mean such that the mean has to move to the right to make this difference smaller, move more individuals to the left side of the mean, and increase the differences of individuals to the left of the mean to balance this one large individual. The median on the other hand will simply put one more individual on the side opposite of the outlier because it balances the number of individuals on each side of it. Thus, the median has to move very little to the right to accomplish this balance. The mean is more sensitive (i.e., changes more) to outliers than the median; it will be pulled towards the outlier more than the median. The shape of the distribution, even if outliers are not present, also has an impact on the mean and median (Figure 5.6). If a distribution is approximately symmetric, then the median and mean (along with the mode) will be nearly identical. If the distribution is left-skewed, then the mean will be less than the median. Finally, if the distribution is right-skewed, then the mean will be greater than the median. Figure 5.6: Three histograms with vertical dashed lines marking the median (blue) and the mean (red). The mean is pulled towards the long tail of a skewed distribution. Thus, the mean is greater than the median for right-skewed distributions and the mean is less than the median for left-skewed distributions. As shown above, the mean and median measure center differently. The question now becomes which measure of center is better? The median is a better measure of center when outliers are present. In addition, the median gives a better measure of a typical individual when the data are skewed. Thus, in this course, the median is used when outliers are present or the distribution of the data is skewed. If the distribution is symmetric, then the purpose of the analysis will dictate which measure of center is better. However, in this course, use the mean when the data are symmetric or, at least, not strongly skewed. As noted above, the IQR and standard deviation behave similarly to the median and mean, respectively, in the face of outliers and skews. Specifically, the IQR is less sensitive to outliers than the standard deviation. In this course, center and dispersion will be measured by the median and IQR if outliers are present or the distribution is more than slightly skewed, and the mean and standar deviation will be used if no outliers are present and the distribution is symmetric or only slightly skewed. 5.1.4 Synthetic Interpretations The graphical and numerical summaries from Module 4 and the rationale described above can be used to construct a synthetic description of the shape, outliers, center, and dispersion of the distribution of a quantitative variable. In the examples below specifically note that 1) shape and outliers are described from the histogram, 2) center and dispersion are described ONLY from the mean and standard deviation OR the median and IQR are discussed, 3) the specific position of outliers (if present) is explained, 4) an explanation is given for why either the median and IQR or the mean and standard deviation were used, and 5) the range was not used alone as a measure of dispersion. 5.1.4.1 Number of Open Pit Mines Construct a proper EDA for the number of open pit mines in countries that have open pit mines as summarized in Table 4.1 and Figure 5.7. Figure 5.7: Histogram of number of open pit mines in countries with open pit mines. Table 5.1: Descriptive statistics of number of open pit mines in countries with open pit mines. n mean sd min Q1 median Q3 max 26 3.62 3.97 1 1 2 4 15 The number of open pit mines in countries with open pit mines is strongly right-skewed with no outliers present (Figure 5.7). [I did not call the group of four countries with 10 or more open pit mines outliers because there were more than one or two countries there.] The center of the distribution is best measured by the median, which is 2 (Table 5.1). The range of open pit mines in the sample is from 1 to 15 while the dispersion as measured by the inter-quartile range (IQR) from a Q1 of 1.0 to a Q3 of 4.0 (Table 5.1). I chose to use the median and IQR because the distribution was strongly skewed. 5.1.4.2 Lake Superior Ice Cover Thoroughly describe the distribution of number of days of ice cover at ice gauge station 9004 in Lake Superior from Figure 5.8 and Table 5.2. Figure 5.8: Histogram of number of days of ice cover at ice gauge 9004 in Lake Superior. Table 5.2: Descriptive statistics of number of days of ice cover at ice gauge 9004 in Lake Superior. n nvalid mean sd min Q1 median Q3 max 42 39 107.8 21.6 48 97 114 118 146 The shape of number of days of ice cover at gauge 9004 in Lake Superior is approximately symmetric with no obvious outliers (Figure 5.8). The center is at a mean of 107.8 days and the dispersion is a standard deviation of 21.6 days (Table 5.2). The mean and standard deviation were used because the distribution was not strongly skewed and no outlier was present. 5.1.4.3 Crayfish Temperature Selection Peck (1985) examined the temperature selection of dominant and subdominant crayfish (Orconectes virilis) together in an artificial stream. The temperature (oC) selection by the dominant crayfish in the presence of subdominant crayfish in these experiments was recorded below. Thoroughly describe all aspects of the distribution of selected temperatures from Figure 5.9 and Table 5.3. Figure 5.9: Histogram of crayfish temperature preferences. Table 5.3: Descriptive statistics of crayfish temperature preferences. n mean sd min Q1 median Q3 max 32 22.88 2.79 16 21 23 25 30 The shape of temperatures selected by the dominant crayfish is slightly left-skewed (Figure 5.9) with a possible weak outlier at the maximum value of 30oC (Table 5.3). The center is best measured by the median, which is 23oC (Table 5.3) and the dispersion is best measured by the IQR, which is from 21 to 25oC (Table 5.3). I used the median and IQR because of the (combined) skewed shape and outlier present. 5.2 Categorical Variable An appropriate EDA for a categorical variable consists of identifying the major characteristics among the categories. Shape, center, dispersion, and outliers are NOT described for categorical data because the data is not numerical and, if nominal, no order exists. In general, the major characteristics of the table or graph are described from an intuitive basis; the numerical values in the graph or table are not simply repeated. Do NOT describe shape, center, dispersion, and outliers for a categorical variable. 5.2.1 Example Interpretations 5.2.1.1 Mixture Seed Count A bag of seeds was purchased for seeding a recently constructed wetland. The purchaser wanted to determine if the percentage of seeds in four broad categories  grasses, sedges, wildflowers, and legumes  was similar to what the seed manufacturer advertised. The purchaser examined a 0.25-lb sample of seeds from the bag and displayed the results in Figure 5.10. Use these results to describe the distribution of seed counts into the four broad categories. Figure 5.10: Bar chart of the percentage of wetland seeds by type. The majority of seeds were either sedge or grass, with sedge being more than twice as abundant as grass (Figure 5.10). Very few legumes or wildflowers were found in the sample. 5.2.1.2 GSS Recycling The General Sociological Survey (GSS) is a very large survey that has been administered 25 times since 1972. The purpose of the GSS is to gather data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes. One question that was asked in a recent GSS was How often do you make a special effort to sort glass or cans or plastic or papers and so on for recycling? The results are displayed in Figure 5.11 and Table 5.4. Use these results to describe the distribution of answers to the question. Figure 5.11: Barplot of the percentage of wetland seeds by type. Table 5.4: Frequency of respondents by response to the question about recycling. Always Often Sometimes Never Not Avail 1289 850 823 448 129 More than twice as many respondents always recycled compared to never recycled, with approximately equal numbers in between that often or sometimes recycled.

The smooth red curve drawn over the histogram serves as a model for the distribution of the entire population. If the smooth curve follows a known distribution, then certain calculations are greatly simplified. Figure 6.1: Depiction of fitting a smooth curve to a histogram to serve as a model for the distribution. The normal distribution is one of the most important distributions in statistics because it serves as a model for the distribution of individuals in many natural situations and the distribution of statistics from repeated samplings (i.e., sampling distributions).23 The use of a normal distribution model to make certain calculations is demonstrated in this module. 6.1 Characteristics of a Normal Distribution The normal distribution is the familiar bell-shaped curve (Figure 6.1-Right). Normal distributions have two parameters  the population mean, \\(\\mu\\), and the population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma\\)  that control the exact shape and position of the distribution. Specifically, the mean \\(\\mu\\) controls the center and the standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) controls the dispersion of the distribution (Figure 6.2). Figure 6.2: Nine normal distributions. Distributions with the same line type have the same value of \\(\\mu\\) (solid is \\(\\mu\\)=0, dashed is \\(\\mu\\)=2, dotted is \\(\\mu\\)=5). Distributions with the same color have the same value of \\(\\sigma\\) (black is \\(\\sigma\\)=0.5, red is \\(\\sigma\\)=1, and green is \\(\\sigma\\)=2). There are an infinite number of normal distributions because there are an infinite number of combinations of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). However, each normal distribution will be bell-shaped and symmetric, centered at \\(\\mu\\), have inflection points at \\(\\mu \\pm \\sigma\\), and have a total area under the curve equal to 1. If a generic variable \\(X\\) follows a normal distribution with a mean of \\(\\mu\\) and a standard deviation of \\(\\sigma\\), then it is said that \\(X\\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma)\\). For example, if the heights of students (\\(H\\)) follows a normal distribution with a \\(\\mu\\) of 66 and a \\(\\sigma\\) of 3, then it is said that \\(H\\sim N(66,3)\\). As another example, \\(Z\\sim N(0,1)\\) means that the variable \\(Z\\) follows a normal distribution with a mean of \\(\\mu\\)=0 and a standard deviation of \\(\\sigma\\)=1. 6.2 Area Under the Curve A common problem is to determine the proportion of individuals with a value of the variable between two numbers. For example, you might be faced with determining the proportion of all sites that have lead concentrations between 1.2 and 1.5 \\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\), the proportion of students that scored higher than 700 on the SAT, or the proportion of Least Weasels that are shorter than 150 mm. Before considering these more realistic situations, we explore calculations for the generic variable \\(X\\) shown in Figure 6.3. Lets consider finding the proportion of individuals in a sample with values between 0 and 2. A histogram can be used to answer this question because it is about the individuals in a sample (Figure 6.3-Left). In this case, the proportion of individuals with values between 0 and 2 is computed by dividing the number of individuals in the red shaded bars by the total number of individuals in the histogram. The analogous computation on the superimposed smooth curve is to find the area under the curve between 0 and 2 (Figure 6.3-Right). The area under the curve is a proportion of the total because, as stated above, the area under the entire curve is equal to 1. The actual calculations on the normal curve are shown in the following sections. However, at this point, note that the calculation of an area on a normal curve is analogous to summing the number of individuals in the appropriate classes of the histogram and dividing by \\(n\\). Figure 6.3: Depiction of finding the proportion of individuals between 0 and 2 on a histogram (Left) and on a standard normal distribution (Right). The proportion of individuals between two values of a variable that is normally distributed is the area under the normal distribution between those two values. 6.3 68-95-99.7 (or Empirical) Rule The 68-95-99.7 (or Empirical) Rule states that 68% of individuals that follow a normal distribution have values between \\(\\mu-1\\sigma\\) and \\(\\mu+1\\sigma\\), 95% have values between \\(\\mu-2\\sigma\\) and \\(\\mu+2\\sigma\\), and 99.7% have values between \\(\\mu-3\\sigma\\) and \\(\\mu+3\\sigma\\) (Figure 6.4). Figure 6.4: Depiction of the 68-95-99.7 (or Empirical) Rule on a normal distribution. The 68-95-99.7 Rule is true no matter what \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are as long as the distribution is normal. For example, if \\(A\\sim N(3,1)\\), then 68% of the individuals will fall between 2 (i.e., 3-11) and 4 (i.e., 3+11) and 99.7% will fall between 0 (i.e., 3-31) and 6 (i.e., 3+31). Alternatively, if \\(B\\sim N(9,3)\\), then 68% of the individuals will fall between 6 (i.e., 9-13) and 12 (i.e., 9+13) and 95% will be between 3 (i.e., 9-23) and 15 (i.e., 9+23). Similar calculations can be made for any normal distribution. The 68-95-99.7 Rule is used to find areas under the normal curve as long as the value of interest is an integer number of standard deviations away from the mean. For example, the proportion of individuals that have a value of A greater than 5 (Figure 6.5) is found by first realizing that 95% of the individuals on this distribution fall between 1 and 5 (i.e., \\(\\pm2\\sigma\\) from \\(\\mu\\)). By subtraction this means that 5% of the individuals must be less than 1 AND greater than 5. Finally, because normal distributions are symmetric, the same percentage of individuals must be less than 1 as are greater than 5. Thus, half of 5%, or 2.5%, of the individuals have a value of A greater than 5. Figure 6.5: The N(3,1) distribution depicting how the 68-95-99.7 Rule is used to compute the percentage of individuals with values greater than 5. The 68-95-99.7 Rule can only be used for questions involving integer standard deviations away from the mean. 6.4 Example Calculations Suppose, for example, that the total miles driven per week by a particular person is normally distributed with a mean of 160 miles and a standard deviation of 25 miles. The following questions can be answered for this situation using the 68-95-99.7% Rule. What percentage of weeks does the driver drive less than 110 miles? 2.5%  110 is exactly 2 standard deviations below the mean (i.e., 160-2×25=110). The area between 2 standard deviations above and below the mean is 95%, so there is 5% outside of those two points. We want only one side of this symmetric distribution, so 5% is split in half to get 2.5%. What percentage of weeks does the driver drive less than 185 miles? 84%  185 is exactly 1 standard deviation above the mean (i.e., 160+1×25). The area between 1 standard deviation above and below the mean is 68%, so there is 32% outside of those two points with 16% in each tail. Thus, the area less than 185 is 68%+16%=84%. What percentage of weeks does the driver drive between 135 and 210 miles? 135 miles is exactly 1 standard deviation below the mean (i.e., 160-1×25=135) and thus has 16% of the area below it. 210 miles is exactly 2 standard deviations above the mean (i.e., 160+2×25=210) and thus has 2.5% of the area above. To get the area between 135 and 210, subtract these combined areas from 100. The following questions, though they sound different, can also be answered with the 68-95-99.7% Rule. What are the miles driven for the highest 16% of miles driven? 185  Hopefully the 16% sounds familiar from above, which relates it to one tail left over from 68%. The question is looking for the highest 16% so i is the upper tail that starts exactly one standard deviatin above the mean (i.e., 160+1×25=185). What are the miles driven for the lowest 2.5% of miles driven? 110  Hopefully the 2.5% sounds familiar from above, which relates it to one tail left over from 95%. The question is looking for the lowest 2.5% so it is the lower tail that starts exactly two standard deviations below the mean (i.e., 160-2×25=110). What are the most common 68% of miles driven? Between 135 and 185  This is simply the first part of the 68-95-99.7% Rule. See the previous plots with 68%. 6.5 Distinguish Calculation Types It is critical to be able to distinguish between two main types of calculations made from normal distributions. The first type of calculation is when you are given a value of the variable (X) and asked to find a percentage of individuals. These questions are called forward questions. The first three questions in the examples of the previous section are forward calculations because the questions gave you miles driven per week values and asked you to find a percentage of weeks. The second type of calculation occurs when you are given a percentage and asked to find the value (or values) of the variable related to that percentage. These calculations are called reverse questions simply to contrast them with the previous forward calculations. The last three questions in the examples of the previous section are reverse calculations because the questions gave you a percentage of weeks and asked you to find a miles driven per week value. Distinguishing between these two types of calculations is a matter of deciding if (i) the value of the variable is given and the percentage (or area) is to be found or (ii) if the percentage (or area) is given and the value of the variable is to be found. Therefore, distinguishing between the calculation types is as simple as identifying what is given (or known) and what must be found. If the value of the variable is given but not the percentage then a forward calculation is used. If the percentage is given then a reverse calculation to find the value of the variable is used. See Module 11. "],["NormalDist2.html", "Module 7 Normal Distribution Calculations 7.1 Forward Calculations 7.2 Reverse Calculations 7.3 Standardization and Z-Scores", " Module 7 Normal Distribution Calculations The normal distribution was introduced in Module 6 and the 68-95-99.7% Rule was used to find the percentage of individuals with particular values of the variable (i.e., a forward calculation) or to find the value or values of the variable with a certain percentage of individuals (i.e., a reverse calculation). Unfortunately, the 68-95-99.7% Rule can only be use if the questions fall exactly 1, 2, or 3 standard deviations away from the mean. In other words, questions relative to non-integer numbers of standard deviations away from the mean can not be found with the 68-95-99.7% Rule and will require special tables or computer software. In this course, we will use a function from the NCStats package in R to perform these calculations. How you use this function depends on whether you will need to make a forward or a reverse calculation (see Section 6.5). 7.1 Forward Calculations The area under a normal curve relative to a particular value is computed in R with distrib(). This function requires the particular value as the first argument and the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution in the mean= and sd= arguments, respectively. The distrib() function defaults to finding the area under the curve to the left of the particular value, but it can find the area under the curve to the right of the particular value by including lower.tail=FALSE. For example, suppose that the heights of a population of students is known to be \\(H\\sim N(66,3)\\). The proportion of students in this population that have a height less than 71 inches is computed below. Thus, approximately 95.2% of students in this population have a height less than 71 inches (Figure 7.1). ( distrib(71,mean=66,sd=3) ) Figure 7.1: Calculation of the proportion of individuals on a \\(N(66,3)\\) with a value less than 71. The proportion of students in this population that have a height greater than 68 inches is computed below (note use of lower.tail=FALSE). Thus, approximately 25.2% of students in this population have a height greater than 68 inches (Figure 7.2). ( distrib(68,mean=66,sd=3,lower.tail=FALSE) ) Figure 7.2: Calculation of the proportion of individuals on a \\(N(66,3)\\) with a value greater than 68. Finding the area between two particular values is a bit more work. To answer between-type questions, the area less than the smaller of the two values is subtracted from the area less than the larger of the two values. This is illustrated by noting that two values split the area under the normal curve into three parts  A, B, and C in Figure 7.3. The area between the two values is B. The area to the left of the larger value corresponds to the area A+B. The area to the left of the smaller value corresponds to the area A. Thus, subtracting the latter from the former leaves the in-between area B (i.e., (A+B)-A = B). Figure 7.3: Schematic representation of how to find the area between two \\(Z\\) values. For example, the area between 62 and 70 inches of height is found below. Thus, 81.8% of students in this population have a height between 62 and 70 inches. ( AB &lt;- distrib(70,mean=66,sd=3) ) # left-of 70 ( A &lt;- distrib(62,mean=66,sd=3) ) # left-of 62 AB-A # between 62 and 70 #R&gt; [1] 0.8175776 Figure 7.4: Calculation of the areas less than 70 inches (Left) and 62 inches (Right). The area between two values is found by subtracting the area less than the smaller value from the area less than the larger value. 7.2 Reverse Calculations Reverse questions are also answered with distrib(), though the first argument is now the given proportion (or area) of interest. The calculation is treated as a reverse question when type=\"q\" is given to distrib().24 For example, the height that has 20% of all students shorter is 63.5 inches, as computed below (Figure 7.5). ( distrib(0.20,mean=66,sd=3,type=&quot;q&quot;) ) Figure 7.5: Calculation of the height with 20% of all students shorter. Greater than reverse questions are computed by including lower.tail=FALSE. For example, 10% of the population of students is taller than 69.8 inches, as computed below (Figure 7.6). ( distrib(0.10,mean=66,sd=3,type=&quot;q&quot;,lower.tail=FALSE) ) Figure 7.6: Calculation of the height with 10% of all students taller. Between questions can only be easily handled if the question is looking for endpoint values that are symmetric about \\(\\mu\\). In other words, the question must ask for the two values that contain the most common proportion of individuals. For example, suppose that you were asked to find the most common 80% of heights. This type of question is handled by converting this symmetric between question into two less than questions. For example, in Figure 7.7 the area D is the symmetric area of interest. If D is 0.80, then C+E must be 0.20.25 Because D is symmetric about \\(\\mu\\), C and E must both equal 0.10. Thus, the lower bound on D is the value that has 10% of all values smaller. Similarly, because the combined area of C and D is 0.90, the upper bound on D is the value that has 90% of all values smaller. This question has now been converted from a symmetric between to two less than questions that can be answered exactly as shown above. Figure 7.7: Depiction of areas in a reverse between type normal distribution question. For example, the two heights that have a symmetric 80% of individuals between them are 62.2 and 69.8 as computed below. ( distrib(0.10,mean=66,sd=3,type=&quot;q&quot;) ) ( distrib(0.90,mean=66,sd=3,type=&quot;q&quot;) ) Figure 7.8: Calculations for the two values with an area of 80% between them. 7.3 Standardization and Z-Scores An individual that is 59 inches tall is 7 inches shorter than average if heights are \\(N(66,3)\\). Is this a large or a small difference? Alternatively, this same individual is \\(\\frac{-7}{3}\\) = \\(-2.33\\) standard deviations below the mean. Thus, a height of 59 inches is relatively rare in this population because few individuals are more than two standard deviations away from the mean.26 As seen here, the relative magnitude that an individual differs from the mean is better expressed as the number of standard deviations that the individual is away from the mean. Values are standardized by changing the original scale (inches in this example) to one that counts the number of standard deviations (i.e., \\(\\sigma\\)) that the value is away from the mean (i.e., \\(\\mu\\)). For example, with the height variable above, 69 inches is one standard deviation above the mean, which corresponds to +1 on the standardized scale. Similarly, 60 inches is two standard deviations below the mean, which corresponds to -2 on the standardized scale. Finally, 67.5 inches on the original scale is one half standard deviation above the mean or +0.5 on the standardized scale. The process of computing the number of standard deviations that an individual is away from the mean is called standardizing. Standardizing is accomplished with \\[Z = \\frac{``\\text{value&quot;}-``\\text{center&quot;}}{``\\text{dispersion&quot;}} \\] or, more specifically, \\[ Z = \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\] For example, the standardized value of an individual with a height of 59 inches is \\(z=\\frac{59-66}{3}=-2.33\\). Thus, this individuals height is 2.33 standard deviations below the average height in the population. Standardized values (\\(Z\\)) follow a \\(N(0,1)\\). Thus, \\(N(0,1)\\) is called the standard normal distribution. The relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Z\\) is one-to-one meaning that each value of \\(X\\) converts to one and only one value of \\(Z\\). This means that the area to the left of \\(X\\) on a \\(N(\\mu,\\sigma)\\) is the same as the area to the left of \\(Z\\) on a \\(N(0,1)\\). This one-to-one relationship is illustrated in Figure 7.9 using the individual with a height of 59 inches and \\(Z=-2.33\\). The standardized scale (i.e., z-scores) represents the number of standard deviations that a value is from the mean. Figure 7.9: Plots depicting the area to the left of 59 on a \\(N(66,3)\\) (Left) and the area to the right of the corresponding Z-score of \\(Z=-2.33\\) on a \\(N(0,1)\\) (Right). Note that the x-axis scales are different. q stands for quantile. Because all three areas must sum to 1. From the 68-95-99.7% Rule.

For example, you may measure (i) the height and weight of students in class, (ii) depth and area of a lake, (iii) gender and age of welfare recipients, or (iv) number of mice and biomass of legumes in fields. This module is focused on describing the bivariate relationship between two quantitative variables. Bivariate relationships between two categorical variables is described in Module 10. Data on the weight (lbs) and highway miles per gallon (HMPG) for 93 cars from the 1993 model year are used as an example throughout this module. Ultimately, the relationship between highway MPG and the weight of a car is described. A sample of these data are shown below. Table 8.1: Sample data from 1993 cars data set. MFG Model Type CMPG HMPG Weight Cyls Acura Integra Small 25 31 2705 4 Acura Legend Midsize 18 25 3560 6 Audi 90 Compact 20 26 3375 6 Volkswagen Corrado Sporty 18 25 2810 6 Volvo 240 Compact 21 28 2985 4 Volvo 850 Midsize 20 28 3245 5 8.1 Response and Explanatory Variables The response variable is the variable that one is interested in explaining something (i.e., variability) or in making future predictions about. The explanatory variable is the variable that may help explain or allow one to predict the response variable. In general, the response variable is thought to depend on the explanatory variable. Thus, the response variable is often called the dependent variable, whereas the explanatory variable is often called the independent variable. One may identify the response variable by determining which of the two variables depends on the other. For example, in the car data, highway MPG is the response variable because gas mileage is most likely affected by the weight of the car (e.g., hypothesize that heavier cars get worse gas mileage), rather than vice versa. In some situations it is not obvious which variable is the response. For example, does the number of mice in the field depend on the number of legumes (lots of feed=lots of mice) or the other way around (lots of mice=not much food left)? Similarly, does area depend on depth or does depth depend on area of the lake? In these situations, the context of the research question is needed to identify the response variable. For example, if the researcher hypothesized that number of mice will be greater if there is more legumes, then number of mice is the response variable. In many cases, the more difficult variable to measure will likely be the response variable. For example, researchers likely wish to predict area of a lake (hard to measure) from depth of the lake (easy to measure). Which variable is the response may depend on the context of the research question. 8.2 Summaries 8.2.1 Scatterplots A scatterplot is a graph where each point simultaneously represents the values of both the quantitative response and quantitative explanatory variable. The value of the explanatory variable gives the x-coordinate and the value of the response variable gives the y-coordinate of the point plotted for an individual. For example, the first individual in the cars data is plotted at x (Weight) = 2705 and y (HMPG) = 31, whereas the second individual is at x = 3560 and y = 25 (Figure 8.1). Figure 8.1: Scatterplot between the highway MPG and weight of cars manufactured in 1993. For reference to the main text, the first individual is red and the second individual is green. 8.2.2 Correlation Coefficient The sample correlation coefficient, abbreviated as \\(r\\), is calculated with \\[ r = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left[\\left(\\frac{x_{i}-\\bar{x}}{s_{x}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{y_{i}-\\bar{y}}{s_{y}}\\right)\\right]}{n-1} \\] where \\(s_{x}\\) and \\(s_{y}\\) are the sample standard deviations for the explanatory and response variables, respectively.27 The formulae in the two sets of parentheses in the numerator are standardized values;28 thus, the value in each parenthesis is called the standardized x or standardized y, respectively. Using this terminology, the equation for \\(r\\) reduces to these steps: For each individual, standardize x and standardize y. For each individual, find the product of the standardized x and standardized y. Sum all of the products from step 2. Divide the sum from step 3 by n-1. Table 8.2 illustrates these calculations for the first five individuals in the cars data.29 Note that the i column is an index for each individual, the \\(x_{i}\\) and \\(y_{i}\\) columns are the observed values of the two variables for individual \\(i\\), \\(\\bar{x}\\) was computed by dividing the sum of the \\(x_{i}\\) column by \\(n\\), \\(s_{x}\\) was computed by dividing the sum of the \\((x_{i}-\\bar{x})^{2}\\) column by \\(n-1\\) and taking the square root, and the std x column are the standardized x values found by dividing the values in the \\(x_{i}-\\bar{x}\\) column by \\(s_{x}\\). Similar calculations were made for the y variable. The final correlation coefficient is the sum of the last column divided by \\(n-1\\). Thus, the correlation between car weight and highway mpg for these five cars is -0.54.

All four of these items can be described from a scatterplot. However, for linear relationships, strength is best described from the correlation coefficient. 8.3.1 Form and Outliers The form of a relationship is determined by whether the cloud of points on a scatterplot forms a line or some sort of curve (Figure 8.4). For the purposes of this introductory course, if the cloud appears linear then the form will be said to be linear, whereas if the cloud is curved then the form will be nonlinear. Scatterplots should be considered linear unless there is an OBVIOUS curvature in the points. Figure 8.2: Depictions of two linear and one nonlinear relationship. An outlier is a point that is far removed from the main cluster of points (Figure 8.3). Keep in mind (as always) that just because a point is an outlier doesnt mean it is wrong. Figure 8.3: Depiction of an outlier (red point) in an otherwise linear scatterplot. 8.3.2 Association or Direction A positive association is when the scatterplot resembles an increasing function (i.e., increases from lower-left to upper-right; Figure 8.4-Left). For a positive association, most of the individuals are above average or below average for both of the variables. A negative association is when the scatterplot looks like a decreasing function (i.e., decreases from upper-left to lower-right; Figure 8.4-Right). For a negative association, most of the individuals are above average for one variable and below average for the other variable. No association is when the scatterplot looks like a shotgun blast of points (Figure 8.4-Center). For no association, there is no tendency for individuals to be above or below average for one variable and above or below average for the other variable. Figure 8.4: Depiction of three types of association present in scatterplots. Dashed vertical lines are at the means of each variable. 8.3.3 Strength (and Association, Again) Strength is a summary of how closely the points cluster about the general form of the relationship. For example, if a linear form exists, then strength is how closely the points cluster around the line. Strength is difficult to define from a scatterplot because it is a relative term. However, the correlation coefficient (\\(r\\); Section 8.2.2) is a measure of strength and association between two variables, if the form is linear. To better understand how \\(r\\) is a measure of association and strength, reconsider the steps in calculating \\(r\\) from Section 8.2.2. The scatterplots in Figure 8.5 represent different associations. These scatterplots have dashed lines at the mean of both the x- and y-axis variables. Because the mean is subtracted from observed values when standardizing, points that fall above the mean will have positive standardized values and points that fall below the mean will have negative standardized values. The sign for the standardized values are depicted along the axes. Figure 8.5: Scatterplot with mean lines (dashed lines) and the signs of standardized values for both x and y shown for different associations. Blue points have a positive product of standardized values, whereas red points have a negative product of standardized values. Now consider the product of standardized xs and ys in each quadrant of the scatterplots in Figure 8.5. The product of standardized values is positive (blue points) in the quadrant where both standardized values are above average (i.e., both positive signs) and both are below average. The product of standardized values is negative (red points) in the other two quadrants. Thus, for a positive association (Figure 8.5-Left) the numerator of the correlation coefficient is positive because it is the sum of many positive (blue points) and few negative (red points) products of standardized values. Therefore, \\(r\\) for a positive association is positive (because the denominator of \\(n-1\\) is always positive). Conversely, for a negative association (Figure 8.5-Right) the numerator of the correlation coefficient is negative because it is the sum of few positive (blue points) and many negative (red points) products of standardized values. Therefore, \\(r\\) for a negative association is negative. Correlations range from -1 to 1. Absolute values of \\(r\\) equal to 1 indicate a perfect association (i.e., all points exactly on a line). A correlation of 0 indicates no association. Thus, absolute values of \\(r\\) near 1 indicate strong relationships and those near 0 are weak. How strength and association of the relationship change along the range of \\(r\\) values is illustrated in Figure 8.6. Guidelines in Table 8.3 can be used to describe the strength of relationship between two variables. Figure 8.6: Scatterplots along the continuum of \\(r\\) values. Table 8.3: Classifications of strength of relationship for absolute values of \\(r\\) by type of study. Statement Observational (Uncontrolled) Experimental (Controlled) Strong &gt;0.8 &gt;0.98 Moderate &gt;$0.6 &gt;0.95 Weak &gt;0.4 &gt;0.9 None &lt;0.4 &lt;0.9 8.4 Example Interpretations When performing a bivariate EDA for two quantitative variables, the form, presence (or absence) of outliers, association, and strength should be specifically addressed. In addition, you should state how you assessed strength. Specifically, you should use \\(r\\) to assess strength (see Section 8.3.3) IF the relationship is linear without any outliers. However, if the relationship is nonlinear, has outliers, or both, then strength should be subjectively assessed from the scatterplot. Two other points should be considered when performing a bivariate EDA with quantitative variables. First, if outliers are present, do not let them completely influence your conclusions about form, association, and strength. In other words, assess these items ignoring the outlier(s). If you have raw data and the form excluding the outlier is linear, then compute \\(r\\) with the outlier eliminated from the data. Second, the form of weak relationships is difficult to describe because, by definition, there is very little clustering to a form. As a rule-of-thumb, if the scatterplot is not obviously curved, then it is described as linear by default. Outliers should not influence the descriptions of association, strength, and form. The form is linear unless there is an OBVIOUS curvature. Finally, in the examples below note that 1) form, outliers, association, and strength are specifically assessed in each; 2) strength is assess from the correlation coefficient and (Table 8.3) only if the form is linear and there are no outliers, 3) the position of outliers is specifically identified, and 4) how strength was assessed was described. Highway MPG and Weight The following overall bivariate summary for the relationship between highway MPG and weight is made using the scatterplot and correlation coefficient from the previous sections. The relationship between highway MPG and weight of cars (Figure 8.1) appears to be primarily linear (although I see a very slight concavity), negative, and moderately strong with a correlation of -0.81. The three points at (2400,46), (2500,27), and (1800,33) might be considered SLIGHT outliers (these are not far enough removed for me to consider them outliers, but some people may). The correlation coefficient was used to assess strength because I deemed the relationship to be linear without any outliers. State Energy Usage A 2001 report from the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy details the total consumption of a variety of energy sources by state in 2001. Construct a proper EDA for the relationship between total petroleum and coal consumption (in trillions of BTU). Figure 8.7: Scatterplot of the total consumption of petroleum versus the consumption of coal (in trillions of BTU) by all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The points shown in the left with total petroleum values greater than 3000 trillion BTU are deleted in the right plot. The relationship between total petroleum and coal consumption is generally linear, with two outliers at total petroleum levels greater than 3000 trillions of BTU, positive, and weak (Figure 8.7-Left). I did not use the correlation coefficient because of the outliers. If the two outliers (Texas and California) are removed then the relationship is linear, with no additional outliers, positive, and weak (\\(r\\)=0.53) (Figure 8.7-Right). Hatch Weight and Incubation Time of Geckos A hobbyist hypothesized that there would be a positive association between length of incubation (days) and hatchling weight (grams) for Crested Geckos (Rhacodactylus ciliatus). To test this hypothesis she collected the incubation time and weight for 21 hatchlings with the results shown below. Construct a proper EDA for the relationship between incubation time and hatchling weight. Figure 8.8: Scatterplot of hatchling weight versus incubation time for Crested Geckos. The relationship between hatchling weight and incubation time for the Crested Geckos is linear, without obvious outliers (though some may consider the small hatchling at 60 days to be an outlier), without a definitive association, and weak (\\(r\\)=0.11) (Figure 8.8). I did compute \\(r\\) because no outliers were present and the relationship was linear (or, at least, it was not nonlinear). 8.5 Cautions About Correlation Examining relationships between pairs of quantitative variables is common practice. Using \\(r\\) can be an important part of this analysis, as described above. However, \\(r\\) can be abused through misapplication and misinterpretation. Thus, it is important to remember the following characteristics of correlation coefficients: Variables must be quantitative (i.e., if you cannot make a scatterplot, then you cannot calculate \\(r\\)). The correlation coefficient only measures strength of LINEAR relationships (i.e., if the form of the relationship is not linear, then \\(r\\) is meaningless and should not be calculated). The units that the variables are measured in do not matter (i.e., \\(r\\) is the same between heights and weights measured in inches and lbs, inches and kg, m and kg, cm and kg, and cm and inches). This is because the variables are standardized when calculating \\(r\\). The distinction between response and explanatory variables is not needed to compute \\(r\\). That is, the correlation of GPA and ACT scores is the same as the correlation of ACT scores and GPA. Correlation coefficients are between -1 and 1. Correlation coefficients are strongly affected by outliers (simply, because both the mean and standard deviation, used in the calculation of \\(r\\), are strongly affected by outliers). Additionally, correlation is not causation! In other words, just because a strong correlation is observed it does not mean that the explanatory variable caused the response variable (an exception may be in carefully designed experiments). For example, it was found above that highway gas mileage decreased linearly as the weight of the car increased. One must be careful here to not state that increasing the weight of the car CAUSED a decrease in MPG because these data are part of an observational study and several other important variables were not considered in the analysis. For example, the scatterplot in Figure 8.9, coded for different numbers of cylinders in the cars engine, indicates that the number of cylinders may be inversely related to highway MPG and positively related to weight of the car. So, does the weight of the car, the number of cylinders, or both, explain the decrease in highway MPG? Figure 8.9: Scatterplot between the highway MPG and weight of cars manufactured in 1993 separated by number of cylinders. More interesting examples (e.g., high correlation between number of people who drowned by falling into a pool and the annual number of films that Nicolas Cage appeared in) that further demonstrate that correlation is not causation can be found on the Spurious Correlations website. Finally, the word correlation is often misused in everyday language. Correlation should only be used when discussing the actual correlation coefficient (i.e., \\(r\\)). When discussing the association between two variables, one should use association or relationship rather than correlation. For example, one might ask What is the relationship between age and rate of cancer? but should not ask (unless specifically interested in \\(r\\)) What is the correlation between age and rate of cancer? See Section 4.1.1.4 for a review of standard deviations. See Section 7.3 for a review of standardized values. The five cars are treated as if they are the entire sample.

Examples include predicting future sales of a product from its price, family expenditures on recreation from family income, an animals food consumption in relation to ambient temperature, and a persons score on a German assessment test based on how many years the person studied German. Exact predictions cannot be made because of natural variability. For example, two people with the same intake of mercury (from consumption of fish) will likely not have the same level of mercury in their blood stream. Thus, the best that can be accomplished is to predict the average or expected value for a person with a particular intake value. This is accomplished by finding the line that best fits the points on a scatterplot of the data and using that line to make predictions. Finding and using the best-fit line is the topic of this module. 9.1 Response and Explanatory Variables Recall from Section 8.1 that the response (or dependent) variable is the variable to be predicted or explained and the explanatory (or independent) variable is the variable that will help do the predicting or explaining. In the examples mentioned above, future sales, family expenditures on recreation, the animals food consumption, and score on the assessment test are response variables and product price, family income, temperature, and years studying German are explanatory variables, respectively. The response variable is on the y-axis and the explanatory variable is on the x-axis of scatterplots. 9.2 Slope and Intercept The equation of a line is commonly expressed as, \\[ y = mx + b \\] where both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are variables, \\(m\\) represents the slope of the line, and \\(b\\) represents the y-intercept.30 It is important that you can look at the equation of a line and identify the response variable, explanatory variable, slope, and intercept. The response variable will always appear on the left side of the equation by itself. The explanatory variable (e.g., \\(x\\)) will be on the right side of the equation and will be multiplied by the slope. The value or symbol by itself on the right side of the equation is the intercept. For example, in \\[ \\text{blood} = 3.501 + 0.579\\text{intake} \\] blood is the response variable, intake is the explanatory variable, \\(0.579\\) is the slope (it is multiplied by the explanatory variable), and \\(3.501\\) is the intercept (it is on the right side and not multiplied by anything). The same conclusions would be made if the equation had been written as \\[ \\text{blood} = 0.579\\text{intake}+3.501 \\] In the equation of a line, the slope is always multiplied by the explanatory variable and the intercept is always by itself. In addition to being able to identify the slope and intercept of a line you also need to be able to interpret these values. Most students define the slope as rise over run and the intercept as where the line crosses the y-axis. These definitions are loose geometric representations. For our purposes, the slope and intercept must be more strictly defined. To define the slope, first think of plugging two values of intake into the equation discussed above. For example, if intake=100, then blood=3.501+0.579×100=61.40 and if intake is one unit larger at 101, then blood=3.501+0.579×101=61.98.31 The difference between these two values is 61.98-61.40=0.579, which is the same as the slope. Thus, the slope is the change in value of the response variable FOR A SINGLE UNIT CHANGE in the value of the explanatory variable (Figure 9.1). That is, mercury in the blood changes 0.579 units FOR A SINGLE UNIT CHANGE in mercury intake. So, if an individual increases mercury intake by one unit, then mercury in the blood will increase by 0.579 units, ON AVERAGE. Alternatively, if one individual has one more unit of mercury intake than another individual, then the first individual will have 0.579 more units of mercury in their blood, ON AVERAGE. Figure 9.1: Schematic representation of the meaning of the intercept and slope in a linear equation. To define the intercept, first plug intake=0 into the equation discussed above; i.e., blood=3.501+0.579×0 = 3.501. Thus, the intercept is the value of the response variable when the explanatory variable is equal to zero (Figure 9.1). In this example, the AVERAGE mercury in the blood for an individual with no mercury intake is 3.501. Many times, as is true with this example, the interpretation of the intercept will be nonsensical. This is because x=0 will likely be outside the range of the data collected and, perhaps, outside the range of possible data that could be collected. The equation of the line is a model for the relationship depicted in a scatterplot. Thus, the interpretations for the slope and intercept represent the average change or the average response variable. Thus, whenever a slope or intercept is being interpreted it must be noted that the result is an average or on average. 9.3 Predictions Once a best-fit line has been identified (criteria for doing so is discussed in Section 9.5), the equation of the line can be used to predict the average value of the response variable for individuals with a particular value of the explanatory variable. For example, the best-fit line for the mercury data shown in Figure 9.2 is \\[ \\text{blood} = 3.501 + 0.579*\\text{intake} \\] Thus, the predicated average level of mercury in the blood for an individual that consumed 240 ug HG/day is found with \\[ \\text{blood} = 3.501 + 0.579*240 = 142.461 \\] Similarly, the predicted average level of mercury in the blood for an individual that consumed 575 ug HG/day is found with \\[ \\text{blood} = 3.501 + 0.579*575 = 336.426 \\] A prediction may be visualized by finding the value of the explanatory variable on the x-axis, drawing a vertical line until the best-fit line is reached, and then drawing a horizontal line over to the y-axis where the value of the response variable is read (Figure 9.2). Figure 9.2: Scatterplot between the intake of mercury in fish and the mercury in the blood stream of individuals with superimposed best-fit regression line illustrating predictions for two values of mercury intake. When predicting values of the response variable, it is important to not extrapolate beyond the range of the data. In other words, predictions with values outside the range of observed values of the explanatory variable should be made cautiously (if at all). An excellent example would be to consider height data collected during the early parts of a humans life (say the first ten years). During these early years there is likely a good fit between height (the response variable) and age. However, using this relationship to predict an individuals height at age 40 would likely result in a ridiculous answer (e.g., over ten feet). The problem here is that the linear relationship only holds for the observed data (i.e., the first ten years of life); it is not known if the same linear relationship exists outside that range of years. In fact, with human heights, it is generally known that growth first slows, eventually quits, and may, at very old ages, actually decline. Thus, the linear relationship found early in life does not hold for later years. Critical mistakes can be made when using a linear relationship to extrapolate outside the range of the data. 9.4 Residuals The predicted value is a best-guess for an individual based on the best-fit line. The actual value for any individual is likely to be different from this predicted value. The residual is a measure of how far off the prediction is from what is actually observed. Specifically, the residual for an individual is found by subtracting the predicted value (given the individuals observed value of the explanatory variable) from the individuals observed value of the response variable, or \\[ \\text{residual}=\\text{observed response}-\\text{predicted response}\\] For example, consider an individual that has an observed intake of 650 and an observed level of mercury in the blood of 480. As shown in the previous section, the predicted level of mercury in the blood for this individual is \\[ \\text{blood} = 3.501 + 0.579*650 = 379.851\\] The residual for this individual is then 480-379.851 = 100.149. This positive residual indicates that the observed value is approximately 100 units GREATER than the average for individuals with an intake of 650.32 As a second example, consider an individual with an observed intake of 250 and an observed level of mercury in the blood of 105. The predicted value for this individual is \\[ \\text{blood} = 3.501 + 0.579*250 = 148.251\\] and the residual is 105-148.251 = -43.251. This negative residual indicates that the observed value is approximately 43 units LESS than the average for individuals with an intake of 250. Visually, a residual is the vertical distance between an individuals point and the best-fit line (Figure 9.3). Figure 9.3: Scatterplot between the intake of mercury in fish and the mercury in the blood stream of individuals with superimposed best-fit regression line illustrating the residuals for the two individuals discussed in the main text. 9.5 Best-fit Criteria An infinite number of lines can be placed on a graph, but many of those lines do not adequately describe the data. In contrast, many of the lines will appear, to our eye, to adequately describe the data. So, how does one find THE best-fit line from all possible lines. The least-squares method described below provides a quantifiable and objective measure of which line best fits the data. Residuals are a measure of how far an individual is from a candidate best-fit line. Residuals computed from all individuals in a data set measure how far all individuals are from the candidate best-fit line. Thus, the residuals for all individuals can be used to identify the best-fit line. The residual sum-of-squares (RSS) is the sum of all squared residuals. The least-squares criterion says that the best-fit line is the one line out of all possible lines that has the minimum RSS (Figure 9.4). Figure 9.4: Scatterplot with the best-fit line (light gray) and candidate best-fit lines (blue line) and residuals (vertical red dashed lines) in the left pane and the residual sum-of-squares for all candidate lines (gray) with the current line highlighted with a red dot. Note how the candidate line is on the best-fit line when the RSS is smallest. The discussion thusfar implies that all possible lines must be fit to the data and the one with the minimum RSS is chosen as the best-fit line. As there are an infinite number of possible lines, this would be impossible to do. Theoretical statisticians have shown that the application of the least-squares criterion always produces a best-fit line with a slope given by \\[ slope = r\\frac{s_{y}}{s_{x}} \\] and an intercept given by \\[ intercept = \\bar{y}-slope*\\bar{x} \\] where \\(\\bar{x}\\) and \\(s_{x}\\) are the sample mean and standard deviation of the explanatory variable, \\(\\bar{y}\\) and \\(s_{y}\\) are the sample mean and standard deviation of the response variable, and \\(r\\) is the sample correlation coefficient between the two variables. Thus, using these formulas finds the slope and intercept for the line, out of all possible lines, that minimizes the RSS. 9.6 Assumptions The least-squares method for finding the best-fit line only works appropriately if each of the following five assumptions about the data has been met. A line describes the data (i.e., a linear form). Homoscedasticity. Normally distributed residuals at a given x. Independent residuals at a given x. The explanatory variable is measured without error. While all five assumptions of linear regression are important, only the first two are vital when the best-fit line is being used primarily as a descriptive model for data.33 Description is the primary goal of linear regression used in this course and, thus, only the first two assumptions are considered further. The linearity assumption appears obvious  if a line does not represent the data, then dont try to fit a line to it! Violations of this assumption are evident by a non-linear or curving form in the scatterplot. The homoscedasticity assumption states that the variability about the line is the same for all values of the explanatory variable. In other words, the dispersion of the data around the line must be the same along the entire line. Violations of this assumption generally present as a funnel-shaped dispersion of points from left-to-right on a scatterplot. Violations of these assumptions are often evident on a fitted-line plot, which is a scatterplot with the best-fit line superimposed (Figure 9.5).34 If the points look more-or-less like random scatter around the best-fit line, then neither the linearity nor the homoscedasticity assumption has been violated. A violation of one of these assumptions should be obvious on the scatterplot. In other words, there should be a clear curvature or funneling on the plot. Figure 9.5: Fitted-line plots illustrating when the regression assumptions are met (upper-left) and three common assumption violations. In this course, if an assumption has been violated, then one should not continue to interpret the linear regression. However, in many instances, an assumption violation can be corrected by transforming one or both variables to a different scale. Transformations are not discussed in this course. If the regression assumptions are not met, then the regression results should not be interpreted. 9.7 Coefficient of Determination The coefficient of determination (\\(r^{2}\\)) is the proportion of the total variability in the response variable that is explained away by knowing the value of the explanatory variable and the best-fit model. In simple linear regression, \\(r^{2}\\) is literally the square of \\(r\\), the correlation coefficient.35 Values of \\(r^{2}\\) are between 0 and 1.36 The meaning of \\(r^{2}\\) can be examined by making predictions of the response variable with and without knowing the value of the explanatory variable. First, consider predicting the value of the response variable without any information about the explanatory variable. In this case, the best prediction is the sample mean of the response variable (represented by the dashed blue horizontal line in Figure 9.6). However, because of natural variability, not all individuals will have this value. Thus, the prediction might be bracketed by predicting that the individual will be between the observed minimum and maximum values (solid blue horizontal lines). Loosely speaking, this range is the total variability in the response variable (blue box). Figure 9.6: Fitted line plot with visual representations of variabilities explained and unexplained. A full explanation is in the text. Suppose now that the response variable is predicted for an individual with a known value of the explanatory variable (e.g., at the dashed vertical red line in Figure 9.6). The predicted value for this individual is the value of the response variable at the corresponding point on the best-fit line (dashed horizontal red line). Again, because of natural variability, not all individuals with this value of the explanatory variable will have this exact value of the response variable. However, the prediction is now bracketed by the minimum and maximum value of the response variable ONLY for those individuals with the same value of the explanatory variable (solid red horizontal lines). Loosely speaking, this range is the variability in the response variable remaining after knowing the value of the explanatory variable (red box). This is the variability in the response variable that remains even after knowing the value of the explanatory variable or the variability in the response variable that cannot be explained away (by the explanatory variable). The portion of the total variability in the response variable that was explained away consists of all the values of the response variable that would no longer be entertained as possible predictions once the value of the explanatory variable is known (green box in Figure 9.6). Now, by the definition of \\(r^{2}\\), \\(r^{2}\\) can be visualized as the area of the green box divided by the area of the blue box. This calculation does not depend on which value of the explanatory variable is chosen as long as the data are evenly distributed around the line (i.e., homoscedasticity  see Section 9.6). If the variability explained away (green box) approaches the total variability in the response variable (blue box), then \\(r^{2}\\) approaches 1. This will happen only if the variability around the line approaches zero. In contrast, the variability explained (green box) will approach zero if the slope is zero (i.e., no relationship between the response and explanatory variables). Thus, values of \\(r^{2}\\) also indicate the strength of the relationship; values near 1 are stronger than values near 0. Values near 1 also mean that predictions will be fairly accurate  i.e., there is little variability remaining after knowing the explanatory variable. A value of \\(r^{2}\\) near 1 represents a strong relationship between the response and explanatory variables that will lead to accurate predictions. 9.8 Examples There are twelve questions that are commonly asked about linear regression results. These twelve questions are listed below with some hints about things to remember when answering some of the questions. An example of these questions in context is then provided. What is the response variable? Identify which variable is to be predicted or explained, which variable is dependent on another variable, which would be hardest to measure, or which is on the y-axis. What is the explanatory variable? The remaining variable after identifying the response variable. Comment on linearity and homoscedasticity. Examine fitted-line plot for curvature (i.e., non-linearity) or a funnel-shape (i.e., heteroscedasticity). What is the equation of the best-fit line? In the generic equation of the line (\\(y=mx+b\\)) replace \\(y\\) with the name of the response variable, \\(x\\) with the name of the explanatory variable, \\(m\\) with the value of the slope, and \\(b\\) with the value of the intercept. Interpret the value of the slope. Comment on how the response variable changes by slope amount for each one unit change of the explanatory variable, on average. Interpret the value of the intercept. Comment on how the response variable equals the intercept, on average, if the explanatory variable is zero. Make a prediction given a value of the explanatory variable. Plug the given value of the explanatory variable into the equation of the best-fit line. Make sure that this is not an extrapolation. Compute a residual given values of both the explanatory and response variables. Make a prediction (see previous question) and then subtract this value from the observed value of the response. Make sure that the prediction is not an extrapolation. Identify an extrapolation in the context of a prediction problem. Examine the x-axis scale on the fitted-line plot and do not make predictions outside of the plotted range. What is the proportion of variability in the response variable explained by knowing the value of the explanatory variable? This is \\(r^{2}\\). What is the correlation coefficient? This is the square root of \\(r^{2}\\). Make sure to put a negative sign on the result if the slope is negative. How much does the response variable change if the explanatory variable changes by X units? This is an alternative to asking for an interpretation of the slope. If the explanatory variable changes by X units, then the response variable will change by X×slope units, on average. All answers should refer to the variables of the problem  thus, y, x, response, or explanatory should not be in any part of any answer. The questions about the slope, intercept, and predictions need to explicitly identify that the answer is an average or on average. All interpretations should be in terms of the variables of the problem rather than the generic terms of x, y, response variable, and explanatory variable. Chimp Hunting Parties Stanford (1996) gathered data to determine if the size of the hunting party (number of individuals hunting together) affected the hunting success of the party (percent of hunts that resulted in a kill) for wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at Gombe. The results of their analysis for 17 hunting parties is shown in the figure below.37 Use these results to answer the questions below. What is the response variable? The response variable is the percent of successful hunts because the authors are attempting to see if success depends on hunting party size. Additionally, the percent of successful hunts is shown on the y-axis. What is the explanatory variable? The explanatory variable is the size of the hunting party. Does any aspect of this regression concern you (i.e., consider the regression assumptions)? The data appear to be very slightly curved but there is no evidence of a funnel-shape. Thus, the data may be slightly non-linear but they appear homoscedastic. In terms of the variables of the problem, what is the equation of the best-fit line? The equation of the best-fit line is % Success of Hunt = 24.21 + 3.71×Number of Hunting Party Members. Interpret the value of the slope in terms of the variables of the problem. The slope indicates that the percent of successful hunts increases by 3.71, on average, for every increase of one member to the hunting party. Interpret the value of the intercept in terms of the variables of the problem. The intercept indicates that the percent of successful hunts is 24.21, on average, for hunting parties with no members. This is nonsensical because 0 hunting members is an extrapolation. What is the predicted hunt success if the hunting party consists of 20 chimpanzees? The predicted hunt success for parties with 20 individuals is an extrapolation, because 20 is outside the range of number of members observed on the x-axis of the fitted-line plot. What is the predicted hunt success if the hunting party consists of 12 chimpanzees? The predicted hunt success for parties with 12 individuals is 24.21 + 3.71×12 = 68.7%. What is the residual if the hunt success for 10 individuals is 50%? The residual in this case is 50-(24.21 + 3.71×10) = 50-61.3 = -11.3. Therefore, it appears that the success of this hunting party is 11.3% lower than average for this size of hunting party. What proportion of the variability in hunting success is explained by knowing the size of the hunting party? The proportion of the variability in hunting success that is explained by knowing the size of the hunting party is \\(r^{2}\\)=0.88. What is the correlation between hunting success and size of hunting party? The correlation between hunting success and size of hunting party is r=0.94. [*Note that this is the square root of \\(r^{2}\\).}] How much does hunt success decrease, on average, if there are two fewer individuals in the party? If the hunting party has two fewer members, then the hunting success would decrease by 7.4% (i.e., -2×3.71), on average. [Note that this is two times the slope, with a negative as it asks about fewer members.] Car Weight and MPG In Module 8, an EDA for the relationship between HMPG (the highway miles per gallon) and Weight (lbs) of 93 cars from the 1993 model year was performed. This relationship will be explored further here as an example of a complete regression analysis. In this analysis, the regression output will be examined within the context of answering the twelve typical questions. The results are shown in Figure 9.7. Figure 9.7: Fitted line plot of the regression of highway MPG on weight of 93 cars from 1993. What is the response variable? The response variable in this analysis is the highway MPG, because that is the variable that we are trying to learn about or explain the variability of. What is the explanatory variable? The explanatory variable in this analysis is the weight of the car (by process of elimination). Do any aspects of this regression fit concern you? The simple linear regression model appears to fit the data moderately well as the fitted-line plot (Figure 9.7) shows only a very slight curvature and only very slight heteroscedasticity.38. In terms of the variables of the problem, what is the equation of the best-fit line? The equation of the best-fit line for this problem is HMPG = 51.6 - 0.0073×Weight. Interpret the value of the slope in terms of the variables of the problem. The slope indicates that for every increase of one pound of car weight the highway MPG decreases by 0.0073, on average. Interpret the value of the intercept in terms of the variables of the problem. The intercept indicates that a car with 0 weight will have a highway MPG value of 51.6, on average. [Note that this is the correct interpretation of the intercept. However, it is nonsensical because it is an extrapolation; i.e., no car will weigh 0 pounds.] What is the predicted highway MPG for a car that weighs 3100 lbs? The predicted highway MPG for a car that weighs 3100 lbs is 51.6 - 0.0073×3100 = 29.0 MPG. What is the predicted highway MPG for a car that weighs 5100 lbs? The predicted highway MPG for a car that weighs 5100 lbs should not be computed with the results of this regression, because 5100 lbs is outside the domain of the data (Figure 9.7). What is the residual for a car that weights 3500 lbs and has a highway MPG of 24? The predicted highway MPG for a car that weighs 3500 lbs is 51.6 - 0.0073×3500 = 26.1. Thus, the residual for this car is 24 - 26.1 = -2.1. Therefore, it appears that this car gets 2.5 MPG LESS than an average car with the same weight. What proportion of the variability in highway MPG is explained by knowing the weight of the car? The proportion of the variability in highway MPG that is explained by knowing the weight of the car is \\(r^{2}\\)=0.66. What is the correlation between highway MPG and car weight? The correlation between highway MPG and car weight is \\(r=\\)-0.81. [*Not that this is the square root of \\(r^{2}\\), but as a negative because form of the relationship between highway MPG and weight is negative.} How much is the highway MPG expected to change if a car is 1000 lbs heavier? If the car was 1000 lbs heavier, you would expect the cars highway MPG to decrease by 7.33. [Note that this is 1000 slopes.] Hereafter, simply called the intercept. For simplicity of exposition, the actual units are not used in this discussion. However, units would usually be replaced with the actual units used for the measurements. In other words, the observed value is above the line. In contrast to using the model to make inferences about a population model. Residual plots, not discussed in this text, are another plot that often times is used to better assess assumption violations. Simple linear regression is the fitting of a model with a single explanatory variable and is the only model considered in this module and this course. See Section 8.2.2 for a review of the correlation coefficient. It is common for \\(r^{2}\\) to be presented as a percentage. These data are in Chimp.csv. In advanced statistics books, objective measures for determining whether there is significant curvature or heteroscedasticity in the data are used. In this book, we will only be concerned with whether there is strong evidence of curvature or heteroscedasticity. There does not seem to be either here.

The General Sociological Survey (GSS) is a very large survey that has been administered 25 times since 1972. The purpose of the GSS is to gather data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes. Data from the following two questions on the GSS are used throughout this module. What is your highest degree earned? [choices  less than high school diploma, high school diploma, junior college, bachelors, or graduate; labeled as degree] How willing would you be to accept cuts in your standard of living in order to protect the environment? [choices  very willing, fairly willing, neither willing nor unwilling, not very willing, or not at all willing; labeled as grnsol] An example of these data are shown below below. degree grnsol ltHS vwill ltHS vwill ltHS vwill grad vun grad vun grad vun 10.1 Frequency Tables A common method of summarizing bivariate categorical data is to count individuals that have each combination of levels of the two categorical variables. For example, how many respondents had less than a HS degree and were very willing, how many had a high school degree and were willing, and so on. The count of the number of individuals of each combination is called a frequency. A two-way frequency table offers an efficient way to display these frequencies (Table 10.1). For example, 40 of the respondents had less than a high school degree and were very willing to take a cut in their standard of living to protect the environment. Similarly, 542 respondents had a high school degree and were willing to cut their standard of living. Table 10.1: Frequency table of respondents highest completed degree (rows) and willingness to cut their standard of living to protect the environment (columns). vwill will neither un vun Sum ltHS 40 145 132 151 178 646 HS 87 542 512 557 392 2090 JC 15 61 64 54 44 238 BS 42 199 179 187 75 682 grad 24 104 83 64 24 299 Sum 208 1051 970 1013 713 3955 The margins of a two-way frequency table may be augmented with row and column totals (as in Table 10.1). Each marginal total represents the distribution of one of the categorical variables, while ignoring the other. The total column represents the distribution of the row variable; in this case, the highest degree completed. The total row represents the distribution of the column variable; in this case, willingness to cut their standard of living to protect the environment. Thus, for example there were 238 respondents whose highest completed degree was junior college and there were 713 respondents who were very unwilling to cut their standard of living to protect the environment. If one variables can be considered as the response, then this variable should form the columns of the frequency table. For example, willingness to cut could be considered the response variable and it was, appropriately, placed as the column variable in Table 10.1. 10.2 Percentage Tables Two-way frequency tables may be converted to percentage tables for ease of comparison between levels of the variables and also between populations. For example, it is difficult to determine from Table 10.1 if respondents with a high school degree are more likely to be very willing to cut their standard of living than respondents with a graduate degree, because there are approximately seven times as many respondents with a high school degree. However, if the frequencies are converted to percentages, then this comparison is easily made. Three types of percentage tables may be constructed from a frequency table. 10.2.1 Total-Percentage Table Each value in a total-percentage table is computed by dividing each cell of the frequency table by the total number of ALL individuals in the frequency table and multiplying by 100. For example, the value in the vwill column and ltHS row of the table-percentage table (Table 10.2) is computed by dividing the value in the vwill column and ltHS row of the frequency table (i.e., 40; Table 10.1) by the Sum of the entire frequency table (i.e., 3955) and multiplying by 100. Table 10.2: Table-percentage table of respondents highest completed degree (rows) and willingness to cut their standard of living to protect the environment (columns). vwill will neither un vun Sum ltHS 1.0 3.7 3.3 3.8 4.5 16.3 HS 2.2 13.7 12.9 14.1 9.9 52.8 JC 0.4 1.5 1.6 1.4 1.1 6.0 BS 1.1 5.0 4.5 4.7 1.9 17.2 grad 0.6 2.6 2.1 1.6 0.6 7.5 Sum 5.3 26.5 24.4 25.6 18.0 99.8 The value in each cell of a total-percentage table is the percentage OF ALL individuals that have the characteristic of that column AND that row. For example, 1.0% of ALL respondents had less than a high school degree AND were very willing to cut their standard of living to protect the environment. In contrast to the interpretations of the row and column-percentage tables below, interpretations from the table-percentages table DOES refer to ALL respondents. 10.2.2 Row-Percentage Table A row-percentage table is computed by dividing each cell of the frequency table by the total in the same row of the frequency table and multiplying by 100 (Table 10.3). For example, the value in the vwill column and ltHS row of the row-percentage table is computed by dividing the value in the vwill column and ltHS row of the frequency table (i.e., 40; Table 10.1) by the Sum of the ltHS row of the frequency table (i.e., 646) and multiplying by 100. Table 10.3: Row-percentage table of respondents highest completed degree (rows) and willingness to cut their standard of living to protect the environment (columns). vwill will neither un vun Sum ltHS 6.2 22.4 20.4 23.4 27.6 100.0 HS 4.2 25.9 24.5 26.7 18.8 100.1 JC 6.3 25.6 26.9 22.7 18.5 100.0 BS 6.2 29.2 26.2 27.4 11.0 100.0 grad 8.0 34.8 27.8 21.4 8.0 100.0 The value in each cell of a row-percentage table is the percentage of individuals in that ROW that have the characteristic of that column. For example, 6.2% of the respondents with less than a high school degree are very willing to cut their standard of living to protect the environment. This statement must be read carefully. OF THE RESPONDENTS WITH LESS THAN A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE, not of all respondents, 6.2% were very willing to cut their standard of living. If the response variable formed the columns, then the row-percentage table allows one to compare percentages in levels of the response (i.e., columns) across groups (i.e., rows). For example, one can see that there is a general decrease in the percentage of respondents that were very unwilling to cut their standard of living to protect the environment as the level of education increased (Table 10.3). 10.2.3 Column-Percentage Table A column-percentage table is computed by dividing each cell of the frequency table by the total in the same column of the frequency table and multiplying by 100 (Table 10.4). For example, the value in the vwill column and ltHS row on the column-percentage table is computed by dividing the value in the vwill column and ltHS row of the frequency table (i.e., 40; Table 10.1) by the Sum of the vwill column of the frequency table (i.e., 208) and multiplying by 100.

For example, 19.2% of respondents who were very willing to cut their standard of living had less than a high school degree. Again, this is a very literal statement. OF THE RESPONDENTS WHO WERE VERY WILLING TO CUT THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING, not of all respondents, 19.2% had less than a high school degree. 10.3 Which Table to Use? Determining which table to use comes from applying one simple rule and practicing with several tables. The rule comes from determining if the question restricts the frame of reference to a particular level or category of one of the variables. If the question does restrict to a particular level, then either the row or column-percentage table that similarly restricts the frame of reference must be used. If a restriction to a particular level is not made, then the total-percentage table is used. For example, consider the question  What percentage of respondents with a bachelors degree were very unwilling to cut their standard of living to protect the environment? This question refers to only respondents with bachelors degrees (i.e.,  of respondents with a bachelors degree ). Thus, the answer is restricted to the BS row of the frequency table. The ROW-percentage table restricts the original table to the row levels and would be used to answer this question. Therefore, 11.0% of respondents with bachelors degrees were very unwilling to cut their standard of living to protect the environment (Table 10.3). Now consider the question  What percentage of all respondents had a high school degree and were very willing to cut their standard of living? This question does not restrict the frame of reference because it refers to  of all respondents . Therefore, from the TOTAL-percentage table (Table 10.2), 2.2% of respondents had a high school degree and were very willing to cut their standard of living. Also consider this question  What percentage of respondents who were neither willing nor unwilling to cut their standard of living had graduate degrees? This question refers only to respondents who were neither willing nor unwilling to cut their standard of living and, thus, restricts the question to the neither column of the frequency table. Thus, the answer will come from the COLUMN-percentage table. Therefore, 8.6% of respondents who were neither willing nor unwilling to cut their standard of living had graduate degrees (Table 10.4). Finally, consider this question  What percentage of all respondents were very willing to cut their standard of living to help the environment? This question has no restrictions, so the total-percentage table would be used. In addition, this question is only concerned with one of the two variables; thus, the answer will come from a marginal distribution. Therefore, 208 out of all 3955 respondents, or 5.3%, were very willing to cut their standard of living to help the environment. To determine which percentage table to use determine what type of restriction, if any, has been placed on the frame of reference for the question. If a question does not refer to one of the two variables, then the answer will generally come from the marginal distribution of the other variable.

This process is difficult becauses statistics depend on the specific individuals in the sample and, thus, vary from sample to sample. For example, recall from Section 2.2 that the mean length of fish differed among four samples taken from Square Lake. Thus, to make conclusions about the population from the sample, the distribution (i.e., shape, center, and dispersion) of the statistic computed from all possible samples must be understood.39 In this module, the distribution of statistics from all possible samples is explored and generalizations are defined that can be used to make inferences. In subsequent modules, this information, along with results from a single sample, will be used to make specific inferences about the population. Statistical inference requires considering sampling variability. 11.1 What is a Sampling Distribution? 11.1.1 Definitions and Characteristics A Sampling distribution is the distribution of values of a particular statistic computed from all possible samples of the same size from the same population. The discussion of sampling distributions and all subsequent theories related to statistical inference are based on repeated samples from the same population. As these theories are developed, we will consider taking multiple samples; however, after the theories have been developed, then only one sample will be taken with the theory then being applied to those results. Thus, it is important to note that only one sample is ever actually taken from a population. The concept of a sampling distribution is illustrated with a population of six students that scored 6, 6, 4, 5, 7 and 8 points, respectively, on an 8-point quiz. The mean of this population is \\(\\mu=\\) 6.000 points and the standard deviation is \\(\\sigma=\\) 1.414 points. Suppose that every sample of size \\(n=2\\) is extracted from this population and that the sample mean is computed for each sample (Table 11.1).40 The sampling distribution of the sample mean from samples of \\(n=2\\) from this population (Figure 11.1) is the histogram of means from these 15 samples.41 Table 11.1: All possible samples of \\(n=2\\) and corresponding sample mean from the quiz score population. Sample Scores Mean 1 6, 6 6.0 2 6, 4 5.0 3 6, 5 5.5 4 6, 7 6.5 5 6, 8 7.0 6 6, 4 5.0 7 6, 5 5.5 8 6, 7 6.5 9 6, 8 7.0 10 4, 5 4.5 11 4, 7 5.5 12 4, 8 6.0 13 5, 7 6.0 14 5, 8 6.5 15 7, 8 7.5 Figure 11.1: Sampling distribution of mean quiz scores from samples of \\(n=2\\) from the quiz score population. The mean (=6.000) and standard deviation (=0.845) of the 15 sample means are measures of center and dispersion for the sampling distribution. The standard deviation of statistics (i.e., dispersion of the sampling distribution) is generally referred to as the standard error of the statistic (abbreviated as \\(SE_{stat}\\)). This new terminology is used to keep the dispersion of the sampling distribution separate from the dispersion of individuals in the population, which is measured by the standard deviation. Thus, the standard deviation of all possible sample means is referred to as the standard error of the sample means (SE). The SE in this example is 0.845. The standard deviation is the dispersion of individuals in the population and, in this example, is 1.414. This example illustrates three major concepts concerning sampling distributions. First, the sampling distribution will more closely resemble a normal distribution than the original population distribution (unless, of course, the population distribution was normal). Second, the center (i.e., mean) of the sampling distribution will equal the parameter that the statistic was intended to estimate (e.g., a sample mean is intended to be an estimate of the population mean). In this example, the mean of all possible sample means (= 6.0 points) is equal to the mean of the original population (\\(\\mu=\\) 6.0 points). A statistic is said to be unbiased if the center (mean) of its sampling distribution equals the parameter it was intended to estimate. This example illustrates that the sample mean is an unbiased estimate of the population mean. Third, the standard error of the statistic is less than the standard deviation of the original population. In other words, the dispersion of statistics is less than the dispersion of individuals in the population. For example, the dispersion of individuals in the population is \\(\\sigma=\\) 1.414 points, whereas the dispersion of statistics from all possible samples is \\(SE_{\\bar{x}}=\\) 0.845 points. All statistics in this course are unbiased. 11.1.2 Critical Distinction Three distributions are considered in statistics. The sampling distribution is the distribution of a statistic computed from all possible samples of the same size from the same population, the population distribution is the distribution of all individuals in a population (see Module 6), and the sample distribution is the distribution of all individuals in a sample (see histograms in Module 4). The sampling distribution is about statistics, whereas the population and sample distributions are about individuals. For inferential statistics, it is important to distinguish between population and sampling distributions. Keep in mind that one (population) is the distribution of individuals and the other (sampling) is the distribution of statistics. Just as importantly, remember that a standard error measures the dispersion among statistics (i.e., sampling variability), whereas a standard deviation measures dispersion among individuals (i.e., natural variability). Specifically, the population standard deviation measures dispersion among all individuals in the population and the sample standard deviation measures dispersion of all individuals in a sample. In contrast, the standard error measures dispersion among statistics computed from all possible samples. The population standard deviation is the dispersion on a population distribution, whereas the standard error is the dispersion on a sampling distribution. 11.1.3 Dependencies The sampling distribution of sample means from samples of \\(n=2\\) from the population of quizzes was shown above. The sampling distribution will look different if any other sample size is used. For example, the samples and means from each sample of \\(n=3\\) are shown in Table 11.2. The mean of these means is 6.000, the standard error is 0.592, and the sampling distribution is symmetric, perhaps approximately normal (Figure 11.2). The three major characteristics of sampling distributions noted in Section ?? are still true: the sampling distribution is still more normal than the original population, the sample mean is still unbiased (i.e, the mean of the means is equal to \\(\\mu\\)), and the standard error is smaller than the standard deviation of the original population. However, also take note that the standard error of the sample mean is smaller from samples of \\(n=3\\) than from \\(n=2\\).42 Table 11.2: All possible samples of \\(n=3\\) and corresponding sample mean from the quiz score population. Sample Scores Mean 1 6, 6, 4 5.333 2 6, 6, 5 5.667 3 6, 6, 7 6.333 4 6, 6, 8 6.667 5 6, 4, 5 5.000 6 6, 4, 7 5.667 7 6, 4, 8 6.000 8 6, 5, 7 6.000 9 6, 5, 8 6.333 10 6, 7, 8 7.000 11 6, 4, 5 5.000 12 6, 4, 7 5.667 13 6, 4, 8 6.000 14 6, 5, 7 6.000 15 6, 5, 8 6.333 16 6, 7, 8 7.000 17 4, 5, 7 5.333 18 4, 5, 8 5.667 19 4, 7, 8 6.333 20 5, 7, 8 6.667 Figure 11.2: Sampling distribution of mean quiz scores from samples of \\(n=3\\) from the quiz score population. The sampling distribution will also be different if the statistic changes; e.g, if the sample median rather than sample mean is computed in each sample. Before showing the results of each sample, note that the population median (i.e., the median of the individuals in the population  6, 6, 4, 5, 7, and 8) is 6.0 points. The sample median from each sample is shown in Table 11.3 and the actual sampling distribution is shown in Figure 11.3. Note that the sampling distribution of the sample medians is still more normal than the original population distribution, the mean of the sample medians (=6.000 points) still equals the parameter (population median) that the sample median is intended to estimate (thus the sample median is also unbiased), and this sampling distribution differs from the sampling distribution of sample means from samples of \\(n=3\\). Table 11.3: All possible samples of \\(n=3\\) and corresponding sample medians from the quiz score population. Sample Scores Mean 1 6, 6, 4 6 2 6, 6, 5 6 3 6, 6, 7 6 4 6, 6, 8 6 5 6, 4, 5 5 6 6, 4, 7 6 7 6, 4, 8 6 8 6, 5, 7 6 9 6, 5, 8 6 10 6, 7, 8 7 11 6, 4, 5 5 12 6, 4, 7 6 13 6, 4, 8 6 14 6, 5, 7 6 15 6, 5, 8 6 16 6, 7, 8 7 17 4, 5, 7 5 18 4, 5, 8 5 19 4, 7, 8 7 20 5, 7, 8 7 Figure 11.3: Sampling distribution of median quiz scores from \\(n=3\\) samples from the quiz score population. These examples demonstrate that the naming of a sampling distribution must be specific. For example, the first sampling distribution in this module should be described as the sampling distribution of sample means from samples of n=2. This last example should be described as the sampling distribution of sample medians from samples of n=3. Doing this with each distribution reinforces the point that sampling distributions depend on the sample size and the statistic calculated. Each sampling distribution should be specifically labeled with the statistic calculated and the sample size of the samples. 11.1.4 Simulating a Sampling Distribution Exact sampling distributions can only be computed for very small samples taken from a small population. Exact sampling distributions are difficult to show for even moderate sample sizes from moderately-sized populations. For example, there are 15504 unique samples of \\(n=5\\) from a population of 20 individuals. How are sampling distributions examined in these and even larger situations? There are two ways to examine sampling distributions in situations with large sample and population sizes. First, theorems exist that describe the specifics of sampling distributions under certain conditions. One such theorem is described in Section 11.2. Second, the computer can take many (hundreds or thousands) samples and compute the statistic for each. These statistics can then be summarized to give an indication of what the actual sampling distribution would look like. This process is called simulating a sampling distribution. We will simulate some sampling distributions here so that the theorem will be easier to understand. Sampling distributions are simulated by drawing many samples from a population, computing the statistic of interest for each sample, and constructing a histogram of those statistics (Figure 11.4). The computer is helpful with this simulation; however, keep in mind that the computer is basically following the same process as used in Section 11.1.1, with the exception that not every sample is taken. Figure 11.4: Schematic representation of the process for simulating a sampling distribution. Lets return to the Square Lake fish population from Section 2.2 to illustrate simulating a sampling distribution. Recall that this is a hypothetical population with 1015 fish, a population distribution shown in Figure 2.1, and parameters shown in Table 2.1. Further recall that four samples of \\(n=50\\) were removed from this population and summarized in Table 2.2 and Table 2.3. Suppose, that an additional 996 samples of \\(n=50\\) were extracted in exactly the same way as the first four, the sample mean was computed in each sample, and the 1000 sample means were collected to form the histogram in Figure 11.5. This histogram is a simulated sampling distribution of sample means because it represents the distribution of sample means from 1000, rather than all possible, samples. Figure 11.5: Histogram (Left) and summary statistics (Right) from 1000 sample mean total lengths computed from samples of \\(n=50\\) from the Square Lake fish population. As with the actual sampling distributions discussed previously, three characteristics (shape, center, and dispersion) are examined with simulated sampling distributions. First, Figure 11.5 looks at least approximately normally distributed. Second, the mean of the 1000 means (=98.02) is approximately equal to the mean of the original 1015 fish in Square Lake (=98.06). These two values are not exactly the same because the simulated sampling distribution was constructed from only a few rather than all possible samples. Third, the standard error of the sample means (=4.18) is much less than the standard deviation of individuals in the original population (=31.49). So, within reasonable approximation, the concepts identified with actual sampling distributions also appear to hold for simulated sampling distributions. As before, computing a different statistic on each sample results in a different sampling distribution. This is illustrated by comparing the sampling distributions of a variety of statistics from the same 1000 samples of size n=50 taken above (Figure 11.6). Figure 11.6: Histograms from 1000 sample median (Left), standard deviation (Center), and range (Right) of total lengths computed from samples of \\(n=50\\) from the Square Lake fish population. Note that the value in the parameter row is the value computed from the entire population. Simulating a sampling distribution by taking many samples of the same size from a population is powerful for two reasons. First, it reinforces the ideas of sampling variability  i.e., each sample results in a slightly different statistic. Second, the entire concept of inferential statistics is based on theoretical sampling distributions. Simulating sampling distributions will allow us to check this theory and better visualize the theoretical concepts. From this module forward, though, remember that sampling distributions are simulated primarily as a check of theoretical concepts. In real-life, only one sample is taken from the population and the theory is used to identify the specifics of the sampling distribution. Simulating sampling distributions is a tool for checking the theory concerning sampling distributions; however, in real-life only one sample from the population is needed. 11.2 Central Limit Theorem The sampling distribution of the sample mean was examined in the previous sections by taking all possible samples from a small population (Section 11.1.1) or taking a large number of samples from a large population (Section 11.1.4). In both instances, it was observed that the sampling distribution of the sample mean was approximately normally distributed, centered on the true mean of the population, and had a standard error that was smaller than the standard deviation of the population and decreased as \\(n\\) increased. In this section, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is introduced and explored as a method to identify the specific characteristics of the sampling distribution of the sample mean without going through the process of extracting multiple samples from the population. The CLT specifically addresses the shape, center, and dispersion of the sampling distribution of the sample means by stating that \\(\\bar{x}\\sim N\\left(\\mu,\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\\) as long as \\(n\\geq30\\), \\(n\\geq15\\) and the population distribution is not strongly skewed, or the population distribution is normally distributed. Thus, the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{x}\\) should be normally distributed no matter what the shape of the population distribution is as long as \\(n\\geq30\\). The CLT also suggests that \\(\\bar{x}\\) is unbiased and that the formula for the \\(SE_{\\bar{x}}\\) is \\(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) regardless of the size of \\(n\\). In other words, \\(n\\) impacts the shape of the sampling distribution of the sample means, but not the center or formula for computing the standard error. The validity of the CLT can be examined by simulating several (with different \\(n\\)) sampling distributions of \\(\\bar{x}\\) from the Square Lake population and from a strongly right-skewed exponential distribution (Figure 11.7). Several observations about the CLT can be made from Figure 11.7. First, the sampling distribution is approximately normal for \\(n\\geq30\\) for both scenarios and is approximately normal for smaller \\(n\\) for the Square Lake example because that population is only slightly skewed. Second, the means of all sampling distributions in both examples are approximately equal to \\(\\mu\\), regardless of \\(n\\). Third, the dispersion of the sampling distributions (i.e., the SE of the means) becomes smaller with increasing \\(n\\). Furthermore, the SE from the simulated results closely match the SE expected from the CLT. Figure 11.7: Sampling distribution of the sample mean simulated from 5000 samples of four different sample sizes extracted from the Square Lake fish population (Left) and an exponential population (Right). The shapes of the populations are shown in the top histogram. On each simulated sampling distribution, the vertical blue line is the mean of the 5000 means and the horizontal red line represents \\(\\pm1\\)SE from the mean. 11.3 Accuracy and Precision Accuracy and precision are often used to describe characteristics of a sampling distribution. Accuracy refers to how closely a statistic estimates the intended parameter. If, on average, a statistic is approximately equal to the parameter it was intended to estimate, then the statistic is considered accurate. Unbiased statistics are also accurate statistics. Precision refers to the repeatability of a statistic. A statistic is considered to be precise if multiple samples produce similar statistics. The standard error is a measure of precision; i.e., a high SE means low precision and a low SE means high precision. The targets in Figure 11.8 provide an intuitive interpretation of accuracy and precision, whereas the sampling distributions (i.e., histograms) are what statisticians look at to identify accuracy and precision. Targets in which the blue plus (i.e., mean of the means) is close to the bullseye are considered accurate (i.e., unbiased). Similarly, sampling distributions where the observed center (i.e., blue vertical line) is very close to the actual parameter (i.e., black tick labeled with a T) are considered accurate. Targets in which the red dots are closely clustered are considered precise. Similarly, sampling distributions that exhibit little variability (low dispersion) are considered precise. Figure 11.8: The center of each target (i.e., the bullseye) and the point marked with a T (for truth) represent the parameter of interest. Each dot on the target represents a statistic computed from a single sample and, thus, the many red dots on each target represent repeated samplings from the same population. The center of the samples (analogous to the center of the sampling distribution) is denoted by a blue plus-sign on the target and a blue vertical line on the histogram. See Module 1 for a review of sampling variability. These samples are found by putting the values into a vector with vals &lt;- c(6,6,4,5,7,8) and then using combn(vals,2). The means are found with mns &lt;- as.numeric(combn(vals,2,mean)). The histogram is constructed with hist(~mns,w=0.5). One should also look at the results from \\(n=4\\) in one of the online Review Exercises. "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
