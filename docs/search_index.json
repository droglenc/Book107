The discovery of contamination from creosote waste in the subsoils and ground water at Kreher Park prompted the city to abandon the project. A subsequent assessment by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) indicated elevated levels of hazardous substances in soil borings, ground water samples, and in the sediments of Chequamegon Bay directly offshore of Kreher Park. In 1995 and 1999, the Northern States Power Company conducted investigations that further defined the area of contamination and confirmed the presence of specific contaminants associated with coal tar wastes. This site was then listed as a superfund site and was given considerably more attention.1 Figure 1.1: Location of the Ashland superfund site (left) with the location of 119 historical sediment sampling sites (right). The WDNR wants to study elements in the sediment (among other things) in the entire 3000 m2 area shaded in Figure 1.1. Is it physically possible to examine every square meter of that area? Is it prudent, ecologically and economically, to examine every square meter of this area? The answer, of course, is no. How then will the WDNR be able to make conclusions about this entire area if they cannot reasonably examine the whole area? The most reasonable solution is to sample a subset of the area and use the results from this sample to make inferences about the entire area. Methods for properly selecting a sample that fairly represents a larger collection of individuals are an important area of study in statistics. For example, the WDNR would not want to sample areas that are only conveniently near shore because this will likely not be an accurate representation of the entire area. In this example, it appears that the WDNR used a grid to assure a relatively even dispersal of samples throughout the study area (Figure 1.1). Methods for choosing the number of individuals to select and how to select those individuals are discussed in Module 3. Suppose that the WDNR measured the concentration of lead at each of the 119 locations shown in Figure 1.1. Further suppose that they presented their results at a public meeting by simply showing the list of lead concentration measurements (Table 1.1). Is it easy to make conclusions about what these data mean from this type of presentation? Table 1.1: Lead concentration (\\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\)) from 119 sites in Kreher Park superfund site.2 0.91 1.09 1.00 1.09 1.06 0.98 0.98 0.94 0.89 1.09 0.91 1.06 0.81 0.90 1.21 1.03 0.95 1.14 0.99 0.99 0.96 1.13 0.84 1.03 0.86 0.98 1.04 0.91 1.27 0.90 0.87 1.23 1.12 0.98 0.79 1.10 1.06 1.09 0.73 0.81 1.18 0.92 0.82 1.11 0.97 1.24 1.06 1.09 0.78 0.94 1.08 0.91 0.98 1.22 1.04 0.77 1.18 0.93 1.14 0.94 1.05 0.91 1.14 0.93 0.94 0.90 1.05 1.36 1.02 0.93 1.09 1.17 0.91 1.06 0.95 0.88 0.67 1.12 1.06 0.99 0.89 0.83 0.99 1.33 1.00 1.05 1.11 1.01 1.25 0.96 1.07 1.17 1.01 1.20 1.17 1.05 1.21 1.10 1.07 1.01 1.16 1.24 0.86 0.90 1.07 1.11 0.99 0.70 0.98 1.11 1.12 1.30 1.00 0.89 0.91 0.95 1.08 1.02 0.93 Instead, suppose that the scientists brought a simple plot of the frequency of observed lead concentrations and brief numerical summaries (Figure 1.2) to the meeting. With these one can easily see that the measurements were fairly symmetric with no obviously weird values. The lead concentrations ranged from as low as 0.67 \\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\) to as high as 1.36 \\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\) with the measurements centered on approximately 1.0 \\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\). These summaries are discussed in detail in Module 4. However, at this point, note that summarizing large quantities of data with few graphical or numerical summaries makes it is easier to identify meaning from data. Figure 1.2: Histogram and summary statistics of lead concentration measurements (\\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\)) at each of 119 sites in Kreher Park superfund site. A critical question at this point is whether or not the results from the one sample of 119 sites perfectly represents the results for the entire area. One way to consider this question is to examine the results obtained from another sample of 119 sites. The results from this second sample (Figure 1.3) are clearly, though not radically, different from the results of the first sample. Thus, it is seen that any one sample from a larger whole will not perfectly represent the large whole. This will lead to some uncertainty in our summaries of the larger whole. Figure 1.3: Histogram and summary statistics of lead concentration measurements (\\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\)) at each of 119 sites (different from the sites shown in Figure 1.2) in Kreher Park superfund site. The results from two different samples do not perfectly agree because each sample contains different individuals (sites in this example), and no two individuals are exactly alike. The fact that no two individuals are exactly alike is natural variability, because of the natural differences that occur among individuals. The fact that the results from different samples are different is called sampling variability. If there was no natural variability, then there would be no sampling variability. If there was no sampling variability, then the field of statistics would not be needed because a sample (even of one individual) would perfectly represent the larger group of individuals. Thus, understanding variability is at the core of statistical practice. Natural and sampling variability will be revisited continuously throughout this course. This may be unsettling! First, it was shown that an entire area or all of the individuals of interest cannot be examined. It was then shown that a sample of individuals from the larger whole did not perfectly represent the larger whole. Furthermore, each sample is unique and will likely lead to a (slightly) different conclusion. These are all real and difficult issues faced by the practicing scientist and considered by the informed consumer. However, the field of statistics is designed to deal with these issues such that the results from a relatively small subset of measurements can be used to make conclusions about the entire collection of measurements. 1.2 Major Goals of Statistics As seen in the Kreher Park example, the field of statistics has two primary purposes. First, statistics provides methods to summarize large quantities of data into concise and informative numerical or graphical summaries. For example, it was easier to discern the general underlying structure of the lead measurements from the statistics and histograms presented in Figures 1.2 and 1.3, than it was from the full list of lead measurements in Table 1.1. Second, statistical methods allow inferences to be made about all individuals (i.e., a population) from a few individuals (i.e., a sample).3 1.3 Why Does Statistics (as a tool) Exist? Besides demonstrating the two major goals of statistics, the Kreher Park example illustrates three realities that exist in nature and life that necessitate the need for statistics as tool for understanding. First, in most realistic situations it is not possible or, at least, not reasonable to see the entire population. For example, it was not reasonable to sample the sediments throughout the entire contaminated area near Kreher Park. In other examples, is it possible (or reasonable) to examine every Northern Short-Tailed Shew (Blarina bevicauda) in Great Lakes states, every person of legal voting age in Wisconsin, or every click on Facebook? Second, as described above, variability exists, both among individuals and results of samples. Third, because we must take samples from populations and those samples are both imperfect representations of the population and sampling variability exists, our conclusions about the population are uncertain. For example, the first sample in the Kreher Park example suggested that the mean lead concentration was 1.02 \\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\), whereas the second sample was 0.98 \\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\). You have also seen this concept when the margin-of-error in poll results are presented. In summary, statistics exist because we must sample instead of observe entire populations, variability is ever present, and the conclusions from samples are uncertain. 1.4 Definition of Statistics Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, and interpreting numerical information or data (Moore and McCabe 1998). People study statistics for a variety of reasons, including (Bluman 2000): To understand the statistical studies performed in their field (i.e., be knowledgeable about the vocabulary, symbols, concepts, and statistical procedures used in those studies). To conduct research in their field (i.e., be able to design experiments and samples; collect, organize, analyze, and summarize data; make reliable predictions or forecasts for future use; and communicate statistical results). To be better consumers of statistical information. Statistics permeates a wide variety of disciplines. Moore and McCabe (1998) state: The study and collection of data are important in the work of many professions, so that training in the science of statistics is valuable preparation for a variety of careers. Each month, for example, government statistical offices release the latest numerical information on unemployment and inflation. Economists and financial advisers, as well as policy makers in government and business study these data in order to make informed decisions. Doctors must understand the origin and trustworthiness of the data that appear in medical journals if they are to offer their patients the most effective treatments. Politicians rely on data from polls of public opinion. Business decisions are based on market research data that reveal customer tastes. Farmers study data from field trials of new crop varieties. Engineers gather data on the quality and reliability of manufactured products. Most areas of academic study make use of numbers, and therefore also make use of the methods of statistics. More information at the EPA and the WDNR websites. These are hypothetical data for this site. Population and sample are defined more completely in Section 2.1. "],["FoundationalDefns.html", "Module 2 Foundational Definitions 2.1 Definitions 2.2 Performing an IVPPSS 2.3 Variable Types", " Module 2 Foundational Definitions Statistical inference is the process of forming conclusions about a parameter of a population from statistics computed from individuals in a sample.4 Thus, understanding statistical inference requires understanding the difference between a population and a sample and a parameter and a statistic. And, to properly describe those items, the individual and variable(s) of interest must be identified. Understanding and identifying these six items is the focus of this module. The following hypothetical example is used throughout this module. Assume that we are interested in the average length of 1015 fish in Square Lake. To illustrate important concepts in this module, assume that all information for all 1015 fish in this lake is known (Figure 2.1). In real life this complete information would not be known. Figure 2.1: Schematic representation of individual fish (i.e., dots; Left) and histogram (Right) of the total length of the 1015 fish in Square Lake. 2.1 Definitions The individual in a statistical analysis is one of the items examined by the researcher.5 Sometimes the individual is a person, but it may be an animal, a piece of wood, a location, a particular time, or an event. It is extremely important that you dont always visualize a person when identifying a statistical individual. An individual in the Square Lake example is a fish because the researcher will examine a characteristic of each particular fish. An individual is not necessarily a person. The variable is the characteristic recorded about each individual. The variable in the Square Lake example is the length of each fish. In most studies, the researcher will record more than one variable. For example, the researcher may also record the fishs weight, sex, age, time of capture, and location of capture. In this module, only one variable is considered, but in other modules two variables will be considered. A population is ALL individuals of interest. In the Square Lake example, the population is all 1015 fish in the lake. The population should be defined as thoroughly as possible including qualifiers, especially those related to time and space, as necessary. This example is simple because Square Lake is so well defined; however, as you will see in the examples below, the population is often only well-defined by your choice of descriptors. A parameter is a summary computed from ALL individuals in a population. In this module the summary will either be the mean or percentage. For example, the mean length (=98.06 mm) and standard deviation (=31.49 mm; Table 2.1) of ALL 1015 fish in Square Lake are both parameters.6 Parameters are ultimately what is of interest because interest is in all individuals in the population. However, in practice, parameters cannot be computed because the entire population cannot usually be seen. Summaries for parameters are preceded by population; e.g., population mean or population standard deviation. Table 2.1: Parameters for the total length of ALL 1015 fish in the Square Lake population. n mean sd min Q1 median Q3 max 1015 98.06 31.49 39 72 93 117 203 Populations and parameters can generally not beseen. To learn something about a population that cannot usually be seen we must sample a subset of that population. The red dots in Figure 2.2 represent a random sample of n=50 fish from Square Lake (note that the sample size is usually denoted by n). Figure 2.2: Schematic representation (Left) of a sample of 50 fish (i.e., red dots) from Square Lake and histogram (Right) of the total length of the 50 fish in this sample. Summaries computed from individuals in a sample are called statistics. The summary for the statistic is always the same as that for the parameter; i.e., the statistic describes the sample in the same way that the parameter describes the population. For example, if mean was used for the parameter then the mean will be used for the statistic. Summaries for statistics are preceded by sample; e.g., sample mean or sample standard deviation. Some statistics computed from the sample from Square Lake are shown in Table 2.2 and Figure 2.2. The sample mean of 107.5 mm is the best guess at the population mean. Not surprisingly from the discussion in Module 1, the sample mean does not perfectly equal the population mean. Table 2.2: Summary statistics for the total length of a sample of 50 fish from the Square Lake population. n mean sd min Q1 median Q3 max 50 107.5 34.26 57 77.25 107.5 134.75 171 A sample represents a population, a statistic represents (or is an estimate of) a parameter. 2.2 Performing an IVPPSS In each statistical analysis it is important that you determine the Individual, Variable, Population, Parameter, Sample, and Statistic. First, determine what items you are actually going to look at; those are the individuals. Second, determine what is recorded about each individual; that is the variable. Third, ALL individuals is the population. Fourth, the summary (e.g., mean or percentage) of the variable recorded from ALL individuals in the population is the parameter.7 Fifth, the population usually cannot be seen, so only a few individuals are examined; those few individuals are the sample. Finally, the summary of the individuals in the sample is the statistic. When performing an IVPPSS, keep in mind that parameters describe populations (note that they both start with p) and statistics describe samples (note that they both start with s). This can also be looked at from another perspective. A sample is an estimate of the population and a statistic is an estimate of a parameter. Thus, the statistic has to be the same summary (mean or percentage) from the sample as the parameter is from the population. Example  Rabbits in Maine The IVPPSS process is illustrated for the following situation: A University of New Hampshire graduate student (and Northland College alum) investigated habitat utilization by New England (Sylvilagus transitionalis) and Eastern (Sylvilagus floridanus) cottontail rabbits in eastern Maine in 2007. In a preliminary portion of his research he determined the percentage of rabbit patches that were inhabited by New England cottontails. He examined 70 patches and found that 53 showed evidence of inhabitance by New England cottontails. An individual is a rabbit patch in eastern Maine in 2007 (i.e., a rabbit patch is the item being sampled and examined). The variable is evidence for New England cottontails (yes or no) (i.e., the characteristic of each rabbit patch that was recorded). The population is ALL rabbit patches in eastern Maine in 2007. The parameter is the percentage of ALL rabbit patches in eastern Maine in 2007 that showed evidence for New England cottontails.8 The sample is the 70 rabbit patches from eastern Maine in 2007 that were actually examined by the researcher. The statistic is the percentage of the 70 rabbit patches from eastern Maine in 2007 actually examined that showed evidence for New England cottontails. [In this case, the statistic would be \\(\\frac{53}{70}\\)×100 or 75.7%.] In the descriptions above, take note that the individual is very carefully defined (including stating a specific time (2007) and place (eastern Maine)), the population and parameter both use the word ALL, the sample and statistic both use the specific sample size (70 rabbits), and the parameter and statistics both use the same summary (i.e., percentage of patches that showed evidence of New England cottontails). Example  Duluth Raptors In some situations it may be easier to identify the sample first. From this, and realizing that a sample is always of the individuals, it may be easier to identify the individual. This process is illustrated in the following example, with the items listed in the order identified rather than in the traditional IVPPSS order. The Duluth, MN Touristry Board is interested in the average number of raptors seen per year at Hawk Ridge.9 To determine this value, they collected the total number of raptors seen in a sample of years from 1971-2003. The sample is the 32 years between 1971 and 2003 at Hawk Ridge. An individual is a year (because a sample of years was taken) at Hawk Ridge. The variable recorded was the number of raptors seen in one year at Hawk Ridge. The population is ALL years at Hawk Ridge.10 The parameter is the average number of raptors seen per year in ALL years at Hawk Ridge. The statistic is the average number of raptors seen in the 1971-2003 sample of years at Hawk Ridge. Again, note that the individual is very carefully defined (including stating a specific time and place), the population and parameter both use the word ALL, the sample and statistic both use the specific sample size (32 years), and the parameter and statistics both use the same summary (i.e., average number of raptors). An individual is usually defined by a specific time and place. *Descriptions for population and parameter will always include the word All. Descriptions for sample and statistic will contain the specific sample size. Descriptions for parameter and statistic will contain the same summary (usually average/mean or proportion/percentage). However the summary is for a different set of individuals  the population for the parameter and the sample for the statistic. 2.2.1 Sampling Variability (Revisited) It is instructive to once again (see Module 1) consider how statistics differ among samples. Table 2.3 and Figure 2.3 show results from three more samples of n=50 fish from the Square Lake population. The means from all four samples (including the sample in Table 2.2 and Figure 2.2) were quite different from the known population mean of 98.06 mm. Similarly, all four histograms were similar in appearance but slightly different in actual values. These results illustrate that a statistic (or sample) will only approximate the parameter (or population) and that statistics vary among samples. This sampling variability is one of the most important concepts in statistics and is discussed in great detail beginning in Module 11. Figure 2.3: Schematic representation (Left) of three samples of 50 fish (i.e., red dots) from Square Lake and histograms (Right) of the total length of the 50 fish in each sample. Table 2.3: Summary statistics for the total length in three samples of 50 fish from the Square Lake population. n mean sd min Q1 median Q3 max 2 50 100.48 31.87 45 78.25 99.5 120.00 180 3 50 99.40 38.28 47 69.00 90.5 113.75 203 4 50 98.14 32.26 45 71.25 87.0 121.50 174 Sampling Variability: The realization that no two samples are exactly alike. Thus, statistics computed from different samples will likely vary. This example also illustrates that parameters are fixed values because populations dont change. If a population does change, then it is considered a different population. In the Square Lake example, if a fish is removed from the lake, then the fish in the lake would be considered a different population. Statistics, on the other hand, vary depending on the sample because each sample consists of different individuals that vary (i.e., sampling variability exists because natural variability exists). Parameters are fixed in value, while statistics vary in value. 2.3 Variable Types The type of statistic that can be calculated is dictated by the type of variable recorded. For example, an average can only be calculated for quantitative variables (defined below). Thus, the type of variable should be identified immediately after performing an IVPPSS. 2.3.1 Variable Definitions There are two main groups of variable types  quantitative and categorical (Figure 2.4). Quantitative variables are variables with numerical values for which it makes sense to do arithmetic operations (like adding or averaging).11 Categorical variables are variables that record which group or category an individual belongs.12 Within each main type of variable are two subgroups (Figure 2.4). Figure 2.4: Schematic representation of the four types of variables. The two types of quantitative variables are continuous and discrete variables. Continuous variables have an uncountable number of values. Discrete variables have a countable number of values. Typically, but not always, discrete variables are counts of items. Continuous and discrete variables are easily distinguished by determining if it is possible for a value to exist between every two values of the variable. If a potential value can always be found between two values then the variable is continuous, otherwise it is discrete. For example, can there be between 2 and 3 ducks on a pond? No! Thus, the number of ducks is a discrete variable. Alternatively, can a duck weigh between 2 and 3 kg? Yes! Can it weigh between 2 and 2.1 kg? Yes! Can it weigh between 2 and 2.01 kg? Yes! You can see that this line of questions could continue forever; thus, duck weight is a continuous variable. A quantitative variable is continuous if a possible value exists between every two values of the variable; otherwise, it is discrete. The two types of categorical variables are ordinal and nominal. Ordinal variables have a natural order or ranking among the categories. Nominal variables have no order or ranking among the categories. Ordinal and nominal variables are easily distinguished by determining if the order of the categories matters. For example, suppose that a researcher recorded a subjective measure of condition (i.e., poor, average, excellent) and the species of each duck. Order matters with the condition variable  i.e., condition improves from the first (poor) to the last category (excellent)  and some reorderings of the categories would not make sense  i.e., average, poor, excellent does not make sense. Thus, condition is an ordinal variable. In contrast, species (e.g., mallard, redhead, canvasback, and wood duck) is a nominal variable because there is no inherent order among the categories (i.e., any reordering of the categories also makes sense). Ordinal means that an order among the categories exists (note ord in both ordinal and order). The following are some issues to consider when identifying the type of a variable: Counts of numbers are discrete (quantitative) variables. Measurements are typically continuous (quantitative) variables. It does not matter how precisely quantitative variables are recorded when deciding if the variable is continuous or discrete. For example, the weight of the duck might have been recorded to the nearest kg. However, this was just a choice that was made, the actual values can be continuously finer than kg and, thus, weight is a continuous variable. The categories of a categorical variable are sometimes labeled with numbers. For example, 1=Poor, 3=Fair, and 5=Good. Dont let this fool you into calling the variable quantitative. Rankings, ratings, and preferences are ordinal (categorical) variables. Categorical variables that consist of only two levels or categories will be labeled as a nominal variable (because any order of the groups makes sense). This type of variable is also often called binomial. Do not confuse what type of variable (answer is one of continuous, discrete, nominal, or ordinal) with what type of variability (answer is natural or sampling) questions. Formal methods of inference are discussed beginning with Module 12. Synonyms for individual are unit, experimental unit (usually used in experiments), sampling unit (usually used in observational studies), case, and subject (usually used in studies involving humans). We will discuss how to compute and interpret each of these values in Module 4. Again, parameters generally cannot be computed because all of the individuals in the population can not be seen. Thus, the parameter is largely conceptual. Note that this population and parameter cannot actually be calculated but it is what the researcher wants to know. Information about Hawk Ridge is found here. This is a bit ambiguous but may be thought of as all years that Hawk Ridge has existed. Synonyms for quantitative are measurement or numerical. Synonyms for categorical are qualitative or attribute. "],["DataProduction.html", "Module 3 Data Production 3.1 Experiments 3.2 Observational Studies  Sampling", " Module 3 Data Production Statistical inference is the process of making conclusions about a population from the results of a single sample. To make conclusions about the larger population, the sample must fairly represent the larger population. Thus, the proper collection (or production) of data is critical to statistics (and science in general). In this module, two ways of producing data  (1) Experiments and (2) Observational Studies  are described. Inferences cannot be made if data are not properly collected. 3.1 Experiments An experiment deliberately imposes a condition on individuals to observe the effect on the response variable. In a properly designed experiment, all variables that are not of interest are held constant, whereas the variable(s) that is (are) of interest are changed among treatments. As long as the experiment is designed properly (see below), differences among treatments are either due to the variable(s) that were deliberately changed or randomness (chance). Methods to determine if differences were likely due to randomness are developed in later modules. Because we can determine if differences most likely occurred due too randomness or changes in the variables, strong cause-and-effect conclusions can be made from data collected from carefully designed experiments. 3.1.1 Single-factor Experiments A factor is a variable that is deliberately manipulated to determine its effect on the response variable. A factor is sometimes called an explanatory variable because we are attempting to determine how it affects (or explains) the response variable. The simplest experiment is a single-factor experiment where the individuals are split into groups defined by the categories of a single factor. For example, suppose that a researcher wants to examine the effect of temperature on the total number of bacterial cells after two weeks. They have inoculated 120 agars13 with the bacteria and placed them in a chamber where all environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, light) are controlled exactly. The researchers will use only two temperatures in this simple experiment  10oC and 15oC. All other variables are maintained at constant levels. Thus, temperature is the only factor in this simple experiment because it is the only variable manipulated to different values to determine its impact on the number of bacterial cells. In a single-factor experiment only one explanatory variable (i.e., factor) is allowed to vary; all other explanatory variables are held constant. Levels are the number of categories of the factor variable. In this example, there are two levels  10oC and 15oC. Treatments are the number of unique conditions that individuals in the experiment are exposed to. In a single-factor experiment, the number of treatments is the same as the number of levels of the single factor. Thus, in this simple experiment, there are two treatments  10oC and 15oC. Treatments are discussed more thoroughly in the next section. The number of replicates in an experiment is the number of individuals that will receive each treatment. In this example, a replicate is an inoculated agar. The number of replicates is the number of inoculated agars that will receive each of the two temperature treatments. The number of replicates is determined by dividing the total number of available individuals (120) by the number of treatments (2). Thus, in this example, the number of replicates is 60 (=\\(\\frac{120}{2}\\)) inoculated agars. The agars used in this experiment will be randomly allocated to the two temperature treatments. All other variables  humidity, light, etc.  are kept the same for each treatment. At the end of two weeks, the total number of bacterial cells on each agar (i.e., the response variable) will be recorded and compared between the agars kept at both temperatures.14 Any difference in mean number of bacterial cells will be due to either different temperature treatments or randomness, because all other variables were the same between the two treatments. Differences among treatments are either caused by randomness (chance) or the factor. The single factor is not restricted to just two levels. For example, more than two temperatures, say 10oC, 12.5oC, 15oC, and 17.5oC, could have been tested. With this modification, there is still only one factor  temperature  but there are now four levels (and four treatments). 3.1.2 Multi-factor Experiments  Design and Definitions More than one factor can be tested in an experiment. In fact, it is more efficient to have a properly designed experiment where more than one factor is varied at a time than it is to use separate experiments in which only one factor is varied in each. However, before showing this benefit, lets examine the definitions from the previous section in a multi-factor experiment. Suppose that the previous experiment was modified to also examine the effect of relative humidity on the number of bacteria cells. This modified experiment has two factors  temperature and relative humidity. In this case, we would say that there are two levels of temperature (10oC or 15oC) and four levels of relative humidity (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%). In other words, keep the levels separate so that you have a number of levels for each factor. You should list as many numbers of levels as you have factors in the experiment. The number of treatments, or combinations of all factors, in this experiment is found by multiplying the levels of all factors (i.e., 2×4=8 in this case). The number of replicates in this experiment is now 15 (=\\(\\frac{120}{8}\\); total number of available agars divided by the number of treatments). The number of treatments is determined for the overall experiment, whereas the number of levels is determined for each factor. A drawing of the experimental design can be instructive (Table 3.1). The drawing is a table where the levels of one factor are shown in the rows of the first column and the levels of the other factor are shown in the rows of the second column such that each level of the first factor is matched with one of the levels of the second factor. With this, the number of rows in the table is the number of treatments in the experiment. I also like to include a column that shows the number of replicates in each treatment and the individuals randomly allocated to each treatment.15 Table 3.1: Diagram of a two-factor experiment with temperature and relative humidity.

However, multi-factor experiments have many benefits, which can be illustrated by comparing a multi-factor experiment to separate single-factor experiments. For example, consider separate single-factor experiments to separately determine the effect of temperature and relative humidity on bacterial growth (further assume that the agars can be used in only one of these separate experiments). To conduct these two separate experiments, the 120 available agars are randomly split into two equally-sized groups of 60. The first 60 will then be split into two groups of 30 for the first experiment with two temperatures. The second 60 will then be split into four groups of 15 for the second experiment with four relative humidities. These separate single-factor experiments are summarized in Table 3.2. Table 3.2: Diagram of two one-factor-at-a-time experiments with temperature (Top) and relative humidity (Bottom). Temp. # Reps Agars 10oC 30 79, 78, 14, 63, 41, 115, 107, 59, 35, 110 ,  15oC 30 39, 42, 82, 47, 101, 106, 29, 113, 2, 53 ,  Rel. Hum. # Reps Agars 20% 15 87, 70, 13, 111, 89, 85, 80, 83, 112, 86, 6, 19, 21, 84, 93 40% 15 12, 45, 66, 31, 30, 22, 90, 72, 7, 120, 27, 50, 23, 71, 69 60% 15 25, 103, 109, 94, 15, 55, 58, 61, 60, 56, 11, 57, 73, 44, 119 80% 15 104, 68, 20, 51, 24, 5, 114, 4, 28, 118, 105, 76, 9, 3, 49 The key to examining the benefits of the multi-factor experiment is to determine the number of individuals that give information about (i.e., are exposed to) each factor. In the two-factor experiment all 120 individuals were exposed to one of the temperature levels with 60 individuals exposed to each level (Table 3.1). In contrast, only 30 individuals were exposed to these levels in the single-factor experiment (Table 3.2-Top). In addition, in the two-factor experiment all 120 individuals were exposed to one of the relative humidity levels with 30 individuals exposed to each level (Table 3.1). Again, this is in contrast to the single-factor experiment where only 15 individuals were exposed to each of these levels (Table 3.2-Bottom). Thus, the first advantage of multi-factor experiments is that the available individuals are used more efficiently. In other words, more information (i.e., the responses of more individuals) is obtained from a multi-factor experiment than from combinations of single-factor experiments.16 A properly designed multi-factor experiment also allows researchers to determine if multiple factors interact to impact an individuals response. For example, consider the hypothetical results from this experiment in Figure 3.1-Left.17 The effect of relative humidity is to increase the growth rate for those individuals at 10oC but to decrease the growth rate for those individuals at 15oC. That is, the effect of relative humidity differs depending on the level of temperature. When the effect of one factor differs depending on the level of the other factor, then the two factors are said to interact. Interactions cannot be determined from the two single-factor experiments because the same individuals are not exposed to levels of the two factors at the same time. Figure 3.1: Mean growth rates in a two-factor experiment that depict an interaction effect (left) and no interaction effect (right). Multi-factor experiments are used to detect the presence or absence of interaction, not just the presence of it. The hypothetical results in Figure 3.1-Right show that the growth rate increases with increasing relative humidity at about the same rate for both temperatures. Thus, because the effect of relative humidity is the same for each temperature (and vice versa), there does not appear to be an interaction between the two factors. Again, this could not be determined from the separate single-factor experiments. 3.1.4 Allocating Individuals Individuals18 should be randomly allocated (i.e., placed into) to treatments. Randomization will tend to even out differences among groups for variables not considered in the experiment. In other words, randomization should help assure that all groups are similar before the treatments are imposed. Thus, randomly allocating individuals to treatments removes any bias (foreseen or unforeseen) from entering the experiment. In the single-factor experiment above  two treatments of temperature  there were 120 agars. To randomly allocate these individuals to the treatments, 60 pieces of paper marked with 10 and 60 marked with 15 could be placed into a hat. One piece of paper would be drawn for each agar and the agar would receive the temperature found on the piece of paper. Alternatively, each agar could be assigned a unique number between 1 and 120 and pieces of paper with these numbers could be placed into the hat. Agars corresponding to the first 60 numbers drawn from the hat could then be placed into the first treatment. Agars for the next (or remaining) 60 numbers would be placed in the second treatment. This process is essentially the same as randomly ordering 120 numbers. A random order of numbers is obtained with R by including the count of numbers as the only argument to sample(). For example, randomly ordering 1 through 120 is accomplished with19 sample(120) #R&gt; [1] 79 78 14 63 41 115 107 59 35 110 8 46 64 99 37 38 81 48 #R&gt; [19] 74 36 77 95 65 91 26 98 1 97 108 62 39 42 82 47 101 106 #R&gt; [37] 29 113 2 53 18 32 52 34 117 100 43 75 116 67 54 10 102 16 #R&gt; [55] 92 88 40 17 96 33 87 70 13 111 89 85 80 83 112 86 6 19 #R&gt; [73] 21 84 93 12 45 66 31 30 22 90 72 7 120 27 50 23 71 69 #R&gt; [91] 25 103 109 94 15 55 58 61 60 56 11 57 73 44 119 104 68 20 #R&gt; [109] 51 24 5 114 4 28 118 105 76 9 3 49 Thus, the first five (of 60) agars in the 10oC treatment are 79, 78, 14, 63, and 41 (Table 3.2-Top). The first five (of 60) agars in the 15oC treatment are 87, 70, 13, 111, and 89 (Table 3.2-Top). In the modified experiment with two factors  temperature and relative humidity  with eight treatments containing 15 agars each, the random numbers would be divided into 8 groups each with 15 numbers. The allocation of individuals was shown in Table 3.1. Individuals should be randomly allocated to treatments to remove bias. 3.1.5 Design Principles There are many other methods of designing experiments and allocating individuals that are beyond the scope of this course.20 However, all experimental designs contain the following three basic principles. Control the effect of variables on the response variable by deliberately manipulating factors to certain levels and maintaining constancy among other variables. Randomize the allocation of individuals to treatments to eliminate bias. Replicate individuals (use many individuals) in the experiment to reduce chance variation in the results. Proper control in an experiment allows for strong cause-and-effect conclusions to be made (i.e., to state that an observed difference in the response variable was due to the levels of the factor or chance variation rather than some other foreseen or unforeseen variable). Randomly allocating individuals to treatments removes any bias that may be included in the experiment. For example, if we do not randomly allocate the agars to the treatments, then it is possible that a set of all poor agars may end up in one treatment. In this case, any observed differences in the response may not be due to the levels of the factor but to the prior quality of the agars. Replication means that there should be more than one or a few individuals in each treatment. This reduces the effect of each individual on the overall results. For example, if there was one agar in each treatment, then, even with random allocation, the effect of that treatment may be due to some inherent properties of that agar rather than the levels of the factors. Replication, along with randomization, helps assure that the groups of individuals in each treatment are as alike as possible at the start of the experiment. 3.2 Observational Studies  Sampling In observational studies the researcher has no control over any of the variables observed for an individual. The researcher simply observes individuals, disturbing them as little as possible, trying to get a picture of the population. Observational studies cannot be used to make cause-and-effect statements because all variables that may impact the outcome may not have been measured or specifically controlled. Thus, any observed difference among groups may be caused by the variables measured, some other unmeasured variables, or chance (randomness). Consider the following as an example of the problems that can occur when all variables are not measured. For many years scientists thought that the brains of females weighed less than the brains of males. They used this finding to support all kinds of ideas about sex-based differences in learning ability. However, these earlier researchers failed to measure body weight, which is strongly related to brain weight in both males and females. After controlling for the effect of differences in body weights, there was no difference in brain weights between the sexes. Thus, many sexist ideas persisted for years because cause-and-effect statements were inferred from data where all variables were not considered. Strong cause-and-effect statements CANNOT be made from observational studies. In observational studies, it is important to understand to which population inferences will refer.21 To make useful inferences from a sample, the sample must be an unbiased representation of the population. In other words, it must not systematically favor certain individuals or outcomes. For example, consider that you want to determine the mean length of all fish in a particular lake (e.g., Square Lake from Module 2). Using a net with large mesh, such that only large fish are caught, would produce a biased sample because interest is in all fish not just the large fish. Setting the nets near spawning beds (i.e., only adult fish) would also produce a biased sample. In both instances, a sample would be collected from a population other than the population of interest. Thus it is important to select a sample from the specified population. It is important to understand the population before considering how to take a sample. 3.2.1 Types of Sampling Designs Three common types of sampling designs  voluntary response, convenience, and probability-based samples  are considered in this section. Voluntary response and convenience samples tend to produce biased samples, whereas proper probability-based samples will produce an unbiased sample. An unbiased sample is desired as it means that no segment of the population was systematically over- or under-represented in the sample. A voluntary response sample consists of individuals that have chosen themselves for the sample by responding to a general appeal. An example of a voluntary response sample would be the group of people that respond to a general appeal placed in the school newspaper. If the population of interest in this sample was all students at the school, then this type of general appeal would likely produce a biased sample of students that (i) read the school newspaper, (ii) feel strongly about the topic, or (iii) both. A more obvious example is the group of people that respond to a Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram poll. A convenience sample consists of individuals who are easiest to reach for the researcher. An example of a convenience sample is when a researcher queries only those students in a particular class. This sample is convenient because the individuals are easy to gather. However, if the population of interest was all students at the school, then this type of sample would likely produce a biased sample of students that is likely of (i) one major or another, (ii) one or a few years-in-school (e.g., Freshman or Sophomores), or (iii) both. In probability-based sampling, each individual of the population has a known chance of being selected for the sample. The simplest probability-based sample is the Simple Random Sample (SRS) where each individual has the same chance of being selected. Proper selection of an SRS requires each individual to be assigned a unique number. The SRS is then formed by choosing random numbers and collecting the individuals that correspond to those numbers. For example, an auditor may need to select a sample of 30 financial transactions from all transactions of a particular bank during the previous month. Because each transaction is numbered, the auditor may know that there were 1112 transactions during the previous month (i.e., the population). The auditor would then number each transaction from 1 to 1112, randomly select 30 numbers (with no repeats) from between 1 and 1112, and then physically locate the 30 transactions that correspond to the 30 selected numbers. Those 30 transactions are the SRS. Random numbers are selected in R by including the population size as the first and sample size as the second argument to sample(). For example, 30 numbers from between 1 and 1112 is selected with sample(1112,30) #R&gt; [1] 684 986 155 638 10 390 381 265 474 707 699 97 752 681 565 #R&gt; [16] 739 59 324 861 637 490 911 446 406 846 516 269 1052 384 1105 Thus, accounts 684, 986, 155, 638, and 10 would be the first five (of 30) selected. There are other more complex types of probability-based samples that are beyond the scope of this course.22 However, the goal of these more complex types of samples is generally to impart more control into the sampling design. A proper SRS requires each individual in the population to be assigned a unique number. If the population is such that a number cannot be assigned to each individual, then the researcher must try to use a method for which they feel each individual has an equal chance of being selected. Usually this means randomizing the technique rather than the individuals. In the fish example discussed previously, the researcher may consider choosing random mesh sizes, random locations for placing the net, or random times for placing the net. Thus, in many real-life instances, the researcher simply tries to use a method that is likely to produce an SRS or something very close to it. If a number cannot be assigned to each individual in the population, then the researcher should randomize the technique to assure as close to a random sample as possible. Polls, campaign or otherwise, are examples of observational studies that you are probably familiar with. The following are links where various aspects of polling are discussed. How Polls are Conducted by Frank Newport, Lydia Saad, and David Moore, The Gallup Organization. Why Do Campaign Polls Zigzag So Much? by G.S. Wasserman, Purdue U. 3.2.2 Of What Value are Observational Studies? Properly designed experiments can lead to cause-and-effect statements, whereas observational studies (even properly designed) are unlikely to lead to such statements. Furthermore, in the last section, it was suggested that it is very difficult to take a proper probability-based sample because it is hard to assign a number to each individual in the population (precisely because entire populations are very difficult to see). So, do observational studies have any value? There are at least three reasons why observational studies are useful. The scientific method begins with making an observation about a natural phenomenon. Observational studies may serve to provide such an observation. Alternatively, observational studies may be deployed after an observation has been made to see if that observation is prevalent and worthy of further investigation. Thus, observational studies may lead directly to hypotheses that form the basis of experiments. Experiments are often conducted under very confined and controlled conditions so that the effect of one or more factors on the response variable can be identified. However, at the conclusion of an experiment it is often questioned whether a similar response would be observed in nature under much less controlled conditions. For example, one might determine that a certain fertilizer increases growth of a certain plant in the greenhouse, with consistent soil characteristics, temperatures, lighting, etc. However, it is a much different, and, perhaps, more interesting, question to determine if that fertilizer elicits the same response when applied to an actual field. This follow-up question would require an observational study. Finally, there are situations where conducting an experiment simply cannot be done, either for ethical, financial, size, or other constraints. For example, it is generally accepted that smoking causes cancer in humans even though an experiment where one group of people was forced to smoke while another was not allowed to smoke has not been conducted. Similarly, it is also very difficult to perform valid experiments on ecosystems. In these situations, an observational study is simply the best study allowable. Cause-and-effect statements are arrived at in these situations because observational studies can be conducted with some, though not absolute, control and control can be imparted mathematically into some analyses.23 In addition, a preponderance of evidence may be arrived at if enough observational studies point to the same conclusion. An agar, in this case, is a petri dish with a growth medium for the bacteria. Methods for making this comparison are in Module 19. How to randomly allocate individuals to treatments is shown in Section 3.1.4. The real importance of this advantage will become apparent when statistical power is introduced in Module 13. The means of each treatment are plotted and connected with lines in this plot. When discussing experiments, an individual is often referred to as a replicate or an experimental unit. In the results below the 120 numbers must be wrapped because they will not fit the page from left-to-right. The numbers is the square brackets at the beginning of each line are NOT random numbers, but are the POSITION of the first number on that line. Thus, the 74 shown on the second line is the 19th random number and the 51 shown on the last line is the 109th random number. Other common designs include blocked, Latin square, and nested designs. Thus, it is very important to first perform an IVPPS as discussed in Module 2. For example, stratified samples, nested, and multistage samples. These analyses are beyond the scope of this book, though. "],["UnivSum.html", "Module 4 Univariate Summaries 4.1 Quantitative Variable 4.2 Categorical Variable", " Module 4 Univariate Summaries Summarizing large quantities of data with few graphical or numerical summaries makes it is easier to identify meaning from data (discussed in Module 1). Numeric and graphical summaries specific to a single variable are described in this module. Interpretations from these numeric and graphical summaries are described in the next module. 4.1 Quantitative Variable Data about the number of open pit mines in countries with open pit mines (Table 4.1)24 and Richter scale recordings for 15 major earthquakes (Table 4.2) will be used throughout this section. Table 4.1: Number of open pit mines in countries that have open pit mines. 4 2 1 2 1 4 4 1 12 4 1 2 1 1 3 11 1 15 4 1 2 2 1 2 11 1 Table 4.2: Richter scale recordings for 15 major earthquakes. 7.8 7.7 6.8 5.5 7.7 8.1 7.3 6.5 6.8 6.3 7.1 7.3 6.5 6.9 7.7 4.1.1 Numerical Summaries A typical value and the variability of a quantitative variable are often described from numerical summaries. Calculation of these summaries is described in this module, whereas their interpretation is described in Module 5. As you will see in Module 5, typical values are measures of center and variability is often described as dispersion (or spread). Three measures of center are the median, mean, and mode. Three measures of dispersion are the inter-quartile range, standard deviation, and range. All measures computed in this module are summary statistics  i.e., they are computed from individuals in a sample. Thus, the name of each measure should be preceded by sample  e.g., sample median, sample mean, and sample standard deviation. These measures could be computed from every individual if the population was known. The values would then be parameters and would be preceded by population  e.g., population median, population mean, and population standard deviation.25 4.1.1.1 Median The median is the value of the individual in the position that splits the ordered list of individuals into two equal-sized halves. In other words, if the data are ordered, half the values will be smaller than the median and half will be larger. The process for finding the median consists of three steps,26 Order the data from smallest to largest. Find the middle position (MP) with MP=\\(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\).27 If MP is an integer (i.e., no decimal), then the median is the value of the individual in that position. If MP is not an integer, then the median is the average of the value immediately below and the value immediately above the MP. As an example, the ordered open pit data from Table 4.1 are shown below. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 4 4 4 4 4 11 11 12 15 Because n=26, the MP=\\(\\frac{26+1}{2}\\)=13.5. The MP is not an integer so the median is the average of the values in the 13th and 14th ordered positions (i.e., the two positions closest to MP). Thus, the median number of open pit mines in this sample of countries is 2 (=\\(\\frac{2+2}{2}\\)). Consider finding the median of the Richter Scale magnitude recorded for fifteen major earthquakes as another example (ordered data below). 5.5 6.3 6.5 6.5 6.8 6.8 6.9 7.1 7.3 7.3 7.7 7.7 7.7 7.8 8.1 Because n=15, the MP=\\(\\frac{15+1}{2}\\)=8. The MP is an integer so the median is the value of the individual in the 8th ordered position, which is 7.1. Dont forget to order the data when computing the median. 4.1.1.2 Inter-Quartile Range Quartiles are the values for the three individuals that divide ordered data into four (approximately) equal parts. Finding the three quartiles consists of finding the median, splitting the data into two equal parts at the median, and then finding the medians of the two halves.28 A concern in this process is that the median is NOT part of either half if there is an odd number of individuals. These steps are summarized as, Order the data from smallest to largest. Find the median  this is the second quartile (Q2). Split the data into two halves at the median. If n is odd (so that the median is one of the observed values), then the median is not part of either half.29 Find the median of the lower half of data  this is the 1st quartile (Q1). Find the median of the upper half of data  this is the third quartile (Q3). These calculations are illustrated with the open pit mine data (the median was computed in Section 4.1.1.1). 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 4 4 4 4 4 11 11 12 15 Because n=26 is even, the halves of the data split naturally into two halves, each with 13 individuals. Therefore, the MP=\\(\\frac{13+1}{2}\\)=7 and the median of each half is the value of the individual in the seventh position. Thus, Q1=1 and Q3=4. In summary, the first, second (i.e,. median), and third quartiles for the open pit mine data are 1, 2, and 4, respectively. These three values separate the ordered individuals into approximately four equally-sized groups  those with values less than (or equal to) 1, with values between (inclusive) 1 and 2, with values between (inclusive) 2 and 4, and with values greater (or equal to) than 4. As another example, consider finding the quartiles for the earthquake data. Recall from Section 4.1.1.1 that the median (=7.1) is in the eighth position of the ordered data. The value in the eighth position will NOT be included in either half when finding the quartiles. 5.5 6.3 6.5 6.5 6.8 6.8 6.9 7.1 7.3 7.3 7.7 7.7 7.7 7.8 8.1 Thus, each half has 7 individuals such that the middle position for each half is MP=\\(\\frac{7+1}{2}\\)=4. The median for each half is the individual in the fourth position of each half so that Q1=6.5 and Q3=7.7. The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between Q3 and Q1, namely Q3-Q1. However, the IQR (as strictly defined) suffers from a lack of information. For example, what does an IQR of 9 mean? It can have a completely different interpretation if the IQR is from 1 to 10 or if it is from 1000 to 1009. Thus, the IQR is more useful if presented as both Q3 and Q1, rather than as the difference. Thus, for example, the IQR for the open pit mine data is from a Q1 of 1 to a Q3 of 4 and the IQR for the earthquake data is from a Q1 of 6.5 to a Q3 of 7. The IQR can be thought of as the range of the middle half of the data. When reporting the IQR, explicitly state both Q1 and Q3 (i.e., do not subtract them). 4.1.1.3 Mean The mean is the arithmetic average of the data. The sample mean is denoted by \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) and the population mean by . The mean is simply computed by adding up all of the values and dividing by the number of individuals. If the measurement of the generic variable x on the ith individual is denoted as xi, then the sample mean is computed with these two steps, Sum (i.e., add together) all of the values  \\(\\sum_{\\text{i=1}}^{\\text{n}}\\text{x}_{\\text{i}}\\). Divide by the number of individuals in the sample  n. or more succinctly summarized with this equation, \\[ \\bar{\\text{x}} = \\frac{\\sum_{\\text{i=1}}^{\\text{n}}\\text{x}_{\\text{i}}}{\\text{n}} \\] For example, the sample mean of the open pit mine data is computed as follows: \\[ \\bar{\\text{x}} = \\frac{2+11+4+1+15+ ... +2+1+4+11+1}{26} = \\frac{94}{26} = 3.6 \\] Note in this example with a discrete variable that it is possible (and reasonable) to present the mean with a decimal. For example, it is not possible for a country to have 3.6 open pit mines, but it IS possible for the mean of a sample of countries to be 3.6 open pit mines. As a general rule-of-thumb, present the mean with one more decimal than the number of decimals it was recorded in. 4.1.1.4 Standard Deviation The sample standard deviation, denoted by s, is computed with these six steps: Compute the sample mean (i.e., \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)). For each value (\\(\\text{x}_{\\text{i}}\\)), find the difference between the value and the mean (i.e., \\(\\text{x}_{\\text{i}}-\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)). Square each difference (i.e., \\((\\text{x}_{\\text{i}}-\\bar{\\text{x}})^{2}\\)). Add together all the squared differences. Divide this sum by n-1. [Stopping here gives the sample variance, s2.] Square root the result from the previous step to get s. These steps are neatly summarized with \\[ s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{\\text{i=1}}^{\\text{n}}(\\text{x}_{\\text{i}}-\\bar{\\text{x}})^{2}}{\\text{n}-1}} \\] The calculation of the standard deviation of the earthquake data is facilitated with the calculations shown in Table 4.3. In Table 4.3, note that \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) is the sum of the Value column divided by n=15 (i.e., \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)=7.07). The Diff column is each observed value minus \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) (i.e., Step 2). The Diff2 column is the square of the differences (i.e., Step 3). The sum of the Diff2 column is Step 4. The sample variance (i.e., Step 5) is equal to this sum divided by n-1=14 or \\(\\frac{6.773}{14}\\)=0.484. The sample standard deviation is the square root of the sample variance or s=\\(\\sqrt{0.484}\\)=0.696.

The standard deviation is greater than zero. Use the fact that the sum of all differences from the mean equals zero as a check of your standard deviation calculation. The standard deviation can be thought of as the average difference between the values and the mean. Thus, on average, each earthquake is approximately 0.70 Richter Scale units different than the average earthquake in these data. This interpretation of s is, however, not a strict definition because the formula for the standard deviation does not simply add the differences and divide by n as this definition would imply. Notice in Table 4.3 that the sum of the differences from the mean is 0. This will be the case for all standard deviation calculations using the correct mean, because the mean balances the distance to individuals below the mean with the distance of individuals above the mean (see Section 5.1.3). Thus, the mean difference will always be zero. This problem is corrected by squaring the differences before summing them. To get back to the original units, the squaring is later reversed by the square root. So, more accurately, the standard deviation is the square root of the average squared differences between the values and the mean. Therefore, the average difference between the values and the mean works as a practical definition of the meaning of the standard deviation, but it is not strictly correct. Further note that the mean is the value that minimizes the value of the standard deviation calculation  i.e., putting any other value besides the mean into the standard deviation equation will result in a larger value. Finally, you may be wondering why the sum of the squared differences in the standard deviation calculation is divided by n-1, rather than n. Recall (from Section 2.1) that statistics are meant to estimate parameters. The sample standard deviation is supposed to estimate the population standard deviation (). Theorists have shown that if we divide by n, s will consistently underestimate . Thus, s calculated in this way would be a biased estimator of . Theorists have found, though, that dividing by n-1 will cause s to be an unbiased estimator of . Being unbiased is generally good  it means that on average our statistic estimates our parameter (this concept is discussed in more detail in Module 11). 4.1.1.5 Mode The mode is the value that occurs most often in a data set. For example, one open pit mine is the mode in the open pit mine data (Table 4.4). Table 4.4: Frequency of countries by each number of open pit mines. Number of Mines 1 2 3 4 11 12 15 Freq of Countries 10 6 1 5 2 1 1 The mode for a continuous variable is the class or bin with the highest frequency of individuals. For example, if 0.5-unit class widths are used in the Richter scale data, then the modal class is 6.5-6.9 (Table 4.5). Table 4.5: Frequency of earthquakes by Richter Scale class. Richter Scale Class 5.5-5.9 6-6.4 6.5-6.9 7-7.4 7.5-7.9 8-8.4 Freq of Earthquakes 1 1 5 3 4 1 Some data sets may have two values or classes with the maximum frequency. In these situations the variable is said to be bimodal. 4.1.1.6 Range The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the data and measures the ultimate dispersion or spread of the data. The range in the earthquake data is 8.1-5.5 = 2.6. The range should never be used by itself as a measure of dispersion. The range is extremely sensitive to outliers and is best used only to show all possible values present in the data. The range (as strictly defined) also suffers from a lack of information in the same way that the IQR did (see above). 4.1.2 Graphical Summaries 4.1.2.1 Histogram A histogram plots the frequency of individuals (y-axis) in classes of values of the quantitative variable (x-axis). Construction of a histogram begins by creating classes of values for the variable of interest. The easiest way to create a list of classes is to divide the range (i.e., maximum minus minimum value) by a nice number near eight to ten, and then round up to make classes that are easy to work with. The nice number between eight and ten is chosen to make the division easy and will be the number of classes. For example, the range of values in the open pit mine example is 15-1 = 14. A nice value near eight and ten to divide this range by is seven. Thus, the classes should be two units wide (=14/7) and, for ease, will begin at 0 (Table 4.6). Table 4.6: Frequency table of number of countries in two-mine-wide classes. Class 0-1 2-3 4-5 6-7 8-9 10-11 12-13 14-15 Frequency 10 7 5 0 0 2 1 1 The frequency of individuals in each class is then counted (shown in the second row of Table 4.6). The plot is prepared with values of the classes forming the x-axis and frequencies forming the y-axis (Figure 4.1-A). The first bar added to this skeleton plot has the bottom-left corner at 0 and the bottom-right corner at 2 on the x-axis, and a height equal to the frequency of individuals in the 0-1 class (Figure 4.1-B). A second bar is then added with the bottom-left corner at 2 and the bottom-right corner at 4 on the x-axis, and a height equal to the frequency of individuals in the 2-3 class (Figure 4.1-C). This process is continued with the remaining classes until the full histogram is constructed (Figure 4.1D). Figure 4.1: Steps (described in text) illustrating the construction of a histogram. Ideally eight to ten classes are used in a histogram. Too many or too few bars make it difficult to identify the shape and may lead to different interpretations. A dramatic example of the effect of changing the number of classes is seen in histograms of the length of eruptions for the Old Faithful geyser (Figure 4.2). Figure 4.2: Histogram of length of eruptions for Old Faithful geyser with varying number of bins/classes. 4.1.2.2 Boxplot The five-number summary consists of the minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum values (effectively contains the range, IQR, and median). For example, the five-number summary for the open pit mine data is 1, 1, 2, 4, and 15 (all values computed in the previous sections). The five-number summary may be displayed as a boxplot. A traditional boxplot (Figure 4.3-Left) consists of a horizontal line at the median, horizontal lines at Q1 and Q3 that are connected with vertical lines to form a box, and vertical lines from Q1 to the minimum and from Q3 to the maximum. In modern boxplots (Figure 4.3-Right) the upper line extends from Q3 to the last observed value that is within 1.5 IQRs of Q3 and the lower line extends from Q1 to the last observed value that is within 1.5 IQRs of Q1. Observed values outside of the whiskers are termed outliers by this algorithm and are typically plotted with circles or asterisks. If no individuals are deemed outliers by this algorithm, then the traditional and modern boxplots will be the same. Figure 4.3: Traditional (Left) and modern (Right) boxplots of the open pit mine data. 4.2 Categorical Variable In this section, methods to construct tables and graphs for categorical data are described. Interpretation of the results is demonstrated in the next module. The concepts are illustrated with data about MTH107 students from the Winter 2020 semester. Specifically, whether or not a student was required to take the courses and the students year-in-school will be summarized. Whether or not a student was required to take the course for a subset of individuals is shown in Table 4.7. Table 4.7: Whether (Y) or not (N) MTH107 was required for eight individuals in MTH107 in Winter 2020. Individual Required 1 Y 2 N 3 N 4 Y 5 Y 6 Y 7 N 8 Y 4.2.1 Numerical Summaries 4.2.1.1 Frequency and Percentage Tables A simple method to summarize categorical data is to count the number of individuals in each level of the categorical variable. These counts are called frequencies and the resulting table (Table 4.8) is called a frequency table. From this table, it is seen that there were five students that were required and three that were not required to take MTH107. Table 4.8: Frequency table for whether MTH107 was required (Y) or not (N) for eight individuals in MTH107 in Winter 2020. Required Frequency N 3 Y 5 The remainder of this module will use results from the entire class rather than the subset used above. For example, frequency tables of individuals by sex and year-in-school for the entire class are in Table 4.9. Table 4.9: Frequency tables for whether (Y) or not (N) MTH107 was required (Left) and year-in-school (Right) for all individuals in MTH107 in Winter 2020. Required Frequency Year Frequency N 30 Fr 19 Y 38 So 12 Jr 29 Sr 9 Frequency tables are often modified to show the percentage of individuals in each level. Percentage tables are constructed from frequency tables by dividing the number of individuals in each level by the total number of individuals examined (n) and then multiplying by 100. For example, the percentage tables for both whether or not MTH107 was required and year-in-school (Table 4.10) for students in MTH107 is constructed from Table 4.9 by dividing the value in each cell by 68, the total number of students in the class, and then multiplying by 100. From this it is seen that 55.9% of students were required to take the course and 13.0% were seniors (Table 4.10). Table 4.10: Percentage tables for whether (Y) or not (N) MTH107 was required (Left) and year-in-school (Right) for all individuals in MTH107 in Winter 2020. Required Percentage Year Percentage N 44.1 Fr 27.5 Y 55.9 So 17.4 Jr 42.0 Sr 13.0 4.2.2 Graphical Summaries 4.2.2.1 Bar Charts Bar charts are used to display the frequency or percentage of individuals in each level of a categorical variable. Bar charts look similar to histograms in that they have the frequency of individuals on the y-axis. However, category labels rather than quantitative values are plotted on the x-axis. In addition, to highlight the categorical nature of the data, bars on a bar chart do not touch. A bar chart for whether or not individuals were required to take MTH107 is in Figure 4.4-Left. This bar chart does not add much to the frequency table because there were only two categories. However, bar charts make it easier to compare the number of individuals in each of several categories as in Figure 4.4-Right. Figure 4.4: Bar charts of the frequency of individuals in MTH107 during Winter 2010 by whether or not they were required to take MTH107 (Left) and year-in-school (Right). Bar charts are used to display the frequency of individuals in the categories of a categorical variable. Histograms are used to display the frequency of individuals in classes created from quantitative variables. These data were collected from this page. See Section 2.1 for clarification on the differences between populations and samples and parameters and statistics. Most computer programs use a more sophisticated algorithm for computing the median and, thus, will produce different results than what will result from applying these steps. Recall that n is the sample size or number of individuals in the sample. You should review how a median is computed before proceeding with this section. Some authors put the median into both halves when n is odd. The difference between the two methods is minimal for large n. "],["UnivEDA.html", "Module 5 Univariate EDA 5.1 Quantitative Variable 5.2 Categorical Variable", " Module 5 Univariate EDA 5.1 Quantitative Variable A univariate EDA for a quantitative variable is concerned with describing the distribution of values for that variable; i.e., describing what values occurred and how often those values occurred. Specifically, the distribution is described with these four attributes: shape of the distribution, presence of outliers, center of the distribution, and dispersion of the distribution. Graphs are used to identify shape and the presence of outliers and to get a general feel for center and dispersion. Numerical summaries, however, are used to specifically describe center and dispersion of the variable. Computing and constructing the required numerical and graphical summaries was described in Module 4. Those summaries are interpreted here to provide an overall description of the distribution of the quantitative variable. The same two data sets used in Module 4 are used here. Number of open pit mines in countries with open pit mines (Table 4.1). Richter scale recordings for 15 major earthquakes (Table 4.2). 5.1.1 Interpreting Shape A distribution has two tails  a left-tail of smaller or more negative values and a right-tail of larger or more positive values (Figure 5.1). The relative appearance of the tails is used to identify the shape of a distribution. If the left- and right-tail are approximately equal in length and height, then the distribution is approximately symmetric. If the left-tail is stretched out or is longer and flatter than the right-tail, then the distribution is left-skewed. If the right-tail is stretched out or is longer and flatter than the left-tail, then the distribution is right-skewed.30 Figure 5.1: Examples of left-skewed, approximately symmetric, and right-skewed histograms. The skewed distributions are more skewed in the top row and less skewed in the bottom row. The longer tail defines the type of skew; a longer right-tail means the distribution is right-skewed and a longer left-tail means it is left-skewed. In practice, these labels form a continuum (Figure 5.1). For example, it may be difficult to discern whether the shape is approximately symmetric or skewed. To partially address this issue, slightly or strongly may be used with skewed to distinguish whether the distribution is obviously skewed (i.e., strongly skewed) or nearly symmetric (i.e., slightly skewed). Shape terms may be modified with approximately, slightly, or strongly. A distribution is bimodal if there are two distinct peaks (Figure 5.2). The shape may be bimodal left-skewed if the left peak is shorter, bimodal symmetric if the two peaks are the same height, or bimodal right-skewed if the right peak is shorter. Figure 5.2: Example of a bimodal left-skewed histograms. Shape may be identified from a histogram or a boxplot (Figure 5.3). Shape is most easily determined from a histogram, as you can focus simply on the longest tail. With boxplots, one must examine the relative length from the median to Q1 and the median to Q3 (i.e., the position of the median line in the box). If the distribution is left-skewed (i.e., lesser-valued individuals are spread out), then the median-Q1 will be greater than Q3-median. In contrast, if the distribution is right-skewed (i.e., larger-valued individuals are spread out), then the Q3-median will be greater than median-Q1. Thus, the median is nearer the top of the box for a left-skewed distribution, nearer the bottom of the box for a right-skewed distribution, and nearer the center of the box for a symmetric distribution (Figure 5.3). Figure 5.3: Histograms and boxplots for several different shapes of distributions. Shape is easier to describe from a histogram than a boxplot. 5.1.2 Interpreting Outliers An outlier is an individual whose value is widely separated from the main cluster of values in the sample. On histograms, outliers appear as bars that are separated from the main cluster of bars by white space or areas with no bars (Figure 5.4). In general, outliers must be on the margins of the histogram, should be separated by one or two missing bars, and should only be one or two individuals. Figure 5.4: Example histogram with an outlier to the right (dark gray). An outlier may be a result of human error in the sampling process and, thus, it should be corrected or removed. Other times an outlier may be an individual that was not part of the population of interest  e.g., an adult animal that was sampled when only immature animals were being considered  and, thus, it should be removed from the sample. Still other times, an outlier is part of the population and should generally not be removed from the sample. In fact you may wish to highlight an outlier as an interesting observation! Regardless, it is important to construct a histogram to determine if outliers are present or not. Dont let outliers completely influence how you define the shape of a distribution. For example, if the main cluster of values is approximately symmetric and there is one outlier to the right of the main cluster (as illustrated in Figure 5.4), DONT call the distribution right-skewed. You should describe this distribution as approximately symmetric with an outlier to the right. Not all outliers warrant removal from your sample. Dont let outliers completely influence how you define the shape of a distribution. 5.1.3 Comparing the Median and Mean As mentioned previously, numerical measures will be used to describe the center and dispersion of a distribution. However, which values should be used? Should one use the mean or the median as a measure of center? Should one use the IQR or the standard deviation as a measure of dispersion? Which measures are used depends on how the measures respond to skew and the presence of outliers. Thus, before stating a rule for which measures should be used, a fundamental difference among the measures discussed in Module 4 is explored here. The following discussion is focused on comparing the mean and the median. However, note that the IQR is fundamentally linked to the median (i.e., to find the IQR, the median must first be found) and the standard deviation is fundamentally linked to the mean (i.e., to find the standard deviation, the mean must first be found). Thus, the median and IQR will always be used together to measure center and dispersion, as will the mean and standard deviation. The mean and median measure center differently. The median balances the number of individuals smaller and larger than it. The mean, on the other hand, balances the sum of the distances to all points smaller than it and the sum of the distances to all points greater than it. Thus, the median is primarily concerned with the position of the value rather than the value itself, whereas the mean is concerned with the values for each individual (i.e., the values are used to find the distance from the mean). A plot of the Richter scale data against the corresponding ordered individual numbers is shown in Figure 5.5-Top. The median (blue line) is the Richter scale value that corresponds to the middle position (i.e., move right from the individual number until the point is intercepted and then move down to the x-axis). Thus, the median (blue line) has the same number of individuals (i.e., points) above and below it. In contrast, the mean finds the Richter scale value that has the same total distance to values below it as total distance to values above it. In other words, the mean (vertical red line) is placed such that the total length of the horizontal dashed red lines (distances from mean to point) is the same to the left as to the right. Figure 5.5: Plot of the individual number versus Richter scale values for the original earthquake data (Top) and the earthquake data with an extreme outlier (Bottom). The median value is shown as a blue vertical line and the mean value is shown as a red vertical line. Differences between each individual value and the mean value are shown with horizontal red lines. The actual values of the data (beyond ordering data) are not considered when calculating the median; whereas the actual values are considered when calculating the mean. The mean balances the distance to individuals above and below the mean. The median balances the number of individuals above and below the median. The sum of all differences between individual values and the mean equals zero. The mean and median differ in their sensitivity to outliers (Figure 5.5). For example, suppose that an incredible earthquake with a Richter Scale value of 19.0 was added to the earthquake data set. With this additional individual, the median increases only from 7.1 to 7.2, but the mean increases from 7.1 to 7.8. The outlier impacts the value of the mean more than the value of the median because of the way that each statistic measures center. The mean will be pulled towards an outlier because it must put many values on the side of the mean away from the outlier so that the sum of the differences to the larger values and the sum of the differences to the smaller values will be equal. In this example, the outlier creates a large difference to the right of the mean such that the mean has to move to the right to make this difference smaller, move more individuals to the left side of the mean, and increase the differences of individuals to the left of the mean to balance this one large individual. The median on the other hand will simply put one more individual on the side opposite of the outlier because it balances the number of individuals on each side of it. Thus, the median has to move very little to the right to accomplish this balance. The mean is more sensitive (i.e., changes more) to outliers than the median; it will be pulled towards the outlier more than the median. The shape of the distribution, even if outliers are not present, also has an impact on the mean and median (Figure 5.6). If a distribution is approximately symmetric, then the median and mean (along with the mode) will be nearly identical. If the distribution is left-skewed, then the mean will be less than the median. Finally, if the distribution is right-skewed, then the mean will be greater than the median. Figure 5.6: Three histograms with vertical dashed lines marking the median (blue) and the mean (red). The mean is pulled towards the long tail of a skewed distribution. Thus, the mean is greater than the median for right-skewed distributions and the mean is less than the median for left-skewed distributions. As shown above, the mean and median measure center differently. The question now becomes which measure of center is better? The median is a better measure of center when outliers are present. In addition, the median gives a better measure of a typical individual when the data are skewed. Thus, in this course, the median is used when outliers are present or the distribution of the data is skewed. If the distribution is symmetric, then the purpose of the analysis will dictate which measure of center is better. However, in this course, use the mean when the data are symmetric or, at least, not strongly skewed. As noted above, the IQR and standard deviation behave similarly to the median and mean, respectively, in the face of outliers and skews. Specifically, the IQR is less sensitive to outliers than the standard deviation. In this course, center and dispersion will be measured by the median and IQR if outliers are present or the distribution is more than slightly skewed, and the mean and standard deviation will be used if no outliers are present and the distribution is symmetric or only slightly skewed. 5.1.4 Synthetic Interpretations The graphical and numerical summaries from Module 4 and the rationale described above can be used to construct a synthetic description of the shape, outliers, center, and dispersion of the distribution of a quantitative variable. In the examples below specifically note that shape and outliers are described from the histogram, center and dispersion are described ONLY from the mean and standard deviation OR the median and IQR, the specific position of outliers (if present) is explained, an explanation is given for why either the median and IQR or the mean and standard deviation were used, and the range was not used alone as a measure of dispersion. 5.1.4.1 Number of Open Pit Mines Construct a proper EDA for the number of open pit mines in countries that have open pit mines as summarized in Table 5.1 and Figure 5.7. Figure 5.7: Histogram of number of open pit mines in countries with open pit mines. Table 5.1: Descriptive statistics of number of open pit mines in countries with open pit mines. n mean sd min Q1 median Q3 max 26 3.62 3.97 1 1 2 4 15 The number of open pit mines in countries with open pit mines is strongly right-skewed with no outliers present (Figure 5.7). [I did not call the group of four countries with 10 or more open pit mines outliers because there were more than one or two countries there.] The center of the distribution is best measured by the median, which is 2 (Table 5.1). The range of open pit mines in the sample is from 1 to 15 while the dispersion as measured by the inter-quartile range (IQR) from a Q1 of 1.0 to a Q3 of 4.0 (Table 5.1). I chose to use the median and IQR because the distribution was strongly skewed. 5.1.4.2 Lake Superior Ice Cover Thoroughly describe the distribution of number of days of ice cover at ice gauge station 9004 in Lake Superior from Figure 5.8 and Table 5.2. Figure 5.8: Histogram of number of days of ice cover at ice gauge 9004 in Lake Superior. Table 5.2: Descriptive statistics of number of days of ice cover at ice gauge 9004 in Lake Superior. n nvalid mean sd min Q1 median Q3 max 42 39 107.8 21.6 48 97 114 118 146 The shape of number of days of ice cover at gauge 9004 in Lake Superior is approximately symmetric with no obvious outliers (Figure 5.8). The center is at a mean of 107.8 days and the dispersion is a standard deviation of 21.6 days (Table 5.2). The mean and standard deviation were used because the distribution was not strongly skewed and no outlier was present. 5.1.4.3 Crayfish Temperature Selection Peck (1985) examined the temperature selection of dominant and subdominant crayfish (Orconectes virilis) together in an artificial stream. The temperature (oC) selection by the dominant crayfish in the presence of subdominant crayfish in these experiments was recorded below. Thoroughly describe all aspects of the distribution of selected temperatures from Figure 5.9 and Table 5.3. Figure 5.9: Histogram of crayfish temperature preferences. Table 5.3: Descriptive statistics of crayfish temperature preferences. n mean sd min Q1 median Q3 max 32 22.88 2.79 16 21 23 25 30 The shape of temperatures selected by the dominant crayfish is slightly left-skewed (Figure 5.9) with a possible weak outlier at the maximum value of 30oC (Table 5.3). The center is best measured by the median, which is 23oC (Table 5.3) and the dispersion is best measured by the IQR, which is from 21 to 25oC (Table 5.3). I used the median and IQR because of the (combined) skewed shape and outlier present. 5.2 Categorical Variable An appropriate EDA for a categorical variable consists of identifying the major characteristics among the categories. Shape, center, dispersion, and outliers are NOT described for categorical data because the data is not numerical and, if nominal, no order exists. In general, the major characteristics of the table or graph are described from an intuitive basis; the numerical values in the graph or table are not simply repeated. Do NOT describe shape, center, dispersion, and outliers for a categorical variable. 5.2.1 Example Interpretations 5.2.1.1 Mixture Seed Count A bag of seeds was purchased for seeding a recently constructed wetland. The purchaser wanted to determine if the percentage of seeds in four broad categories  grasses, sedges, wildflowers, and legumes  was similar to what the seed manufacturer advertised. The purchaser examined a 0.25-lb sample of seeds from the bag and displayed the results in Figure 5.10. Use these results to describe the distribution of seed counts into the four broad categories. Figure 5.10: Bar chart of the percentage of wetland seeds by type. The majority of seeds were either sedge or grass, with sedge being more than twice as abundant as grass (Figure 5.10). Very few legumes or wildflowers were found in the sample. 5.2.1.2 GSS Recycling The General Sociological Survey (GSS) is a very large survey that has been administered 25 times since 1972. The purpose of the GSS is to gather data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes. One question that was asked in a recent GSS was How often do you make a special effort to sort glass or cans or plastic or papers and so on for recycling? The results are displayed in Figure 5.11 and Table 5.4. Use these results to describe the distribution of answers to the question. Figure 5.11: Barplot of the percentage of wetland seeds by type. Table 5.4: Frequency of respondents by response to the question about recycling. Always Often Sometimes Never Not Avail 1289 850 823 448 129 More than twice as many respondents always recycled compared to never recycled, with approximately equal numbers in between that often or sometimes recycled. Some people use negatively skewed instead of left-skewed and positively skewed instead of right-skewed. When using these think that left means more towards negaive values and right means more towards positive values. "],["NormalDist1.html", "Module 6 Normal Distribution Introduction 6.1 Characteristics of a Normal Distribution 6.2 Area Under the Curve 6.3 68-95-99.7 (or Empirical) Rule 6.4 Example Calculations 6.5 Distinguish Calculation Types", " Module 6 Normal Distribution Introduction A model for the distribution of a single quantitative variable can be visualized by fitting a smooth curve to a histogram (Figure 6.1-Left), removing the histogram (Figure 6.1-Center), and using the remaining curve (Figure 6.1-Right) as a model for the distribution of the entire population of individuals. If the smooth curve follows a known distribution, then certain calculations are greatly simplified. Figure 6.1: Depiction of fitting a smooth curve to a histogram to serve as a model for the distribution. The normal distribution is one of the most important distributions in statistics because it serves as a model for the distribution of individuals in many natural situations and the distribution of statistics from repeated samplings (i.e., sampling distributions).31 The use of a normal distribution model to make certain calculations is demonstrated in this module. More complex calculations are described in the next module. 6.1 Characteristics of a Normal Distribution The normal distribution is the familiar bell-shaped curve (Figure 6.1-Right). Normal distributions have two parameters  the population mean, , and the population standard deviation,   that control the exact shape and position of the distribution. Specifically, the mean  controls the center and the standard deviation  controls the dispersion of the distribution (Figure 6.2). Figure 6.2: Nine normal distributions. Distributions with the same line type have the same value of  (solid is =0, dashed is =2, dotted is =5). Distributions with the same color have the same value of  (black is =0.5, red is =1, and green is =2). There are an infinite number of normal distributions for each of the infinite number of combinations of  and . However, each normal distribution is bell-shaped and symmetric, is centered at , has inflection points at ±, and has a total area under the curve equal to 1. If a generic variable X follows a normal distribution with a mean of  and a standard deviation of , then it is said that X~N(,). For example, if the heights of students (H) follows a normal distribution with a mean of 66 and a standard deviation of 3, then it is said that H~N(66,3). As another example, Z~N(0,1) means that the variable Z follows a normal distribution with a mean of =0 and a standard deviation of =1. 6.2 Area Under the Curve A common question in statistics is to determine the proportion of individuals with a value of the variable between two numbers. For example, you might be faced with determining the proportion of all sites that have lead concentrations between 1.2 and 1.5 \\(\\mu g \\cdot m^{-3}\\), the proportion of students that scored higher than 700 on the SAT, or the proportion of Least Weasels that are shorter than 150 mm. Before considering these more realistic situations, lets explore calculations for the generic variable X shown in Figure 6.3. Consider finding the proportion of individuals in a sample with values between 0 and 2. A histogram can be used to answer this question because it is about the individuals in a sample (Figure 6.3-Left). In this case, the proportion of individuals with values between 0 and 2 is computed by dividing the number of individuals in the red shaded bars by the total number of individuals in the histogram. The analogous computation on the superimposed smooth curve is to find the area under the curve between 0 and 2 (Figure 6.3-Right). The area under the curve is a proportion of the total because, as stated above, the area under the entire curve is equal to 1. Figure 6.3: Depiction of finding the proportion of individuals between 0 and 2 on a histogram (Left) and on a standard normal distribution (Right). The proportion of individuals between two values of a variable that is normally distributed is the area under the normal distribution between those two values. This area is analogous to summing the number of individuals in the appropriate bars of a histogram and dividing by n. 6.3 68-95-99.7 (or Empirical) Rule The 68-95-99.7 (or Empirical) Rule states that 68% of individuals that follow a normal distribution have values between -1 and +1, 95% have values between -2 and +2, and 99.7% have values between -3 and +3 (Figure 6.4). Figure 6.4: Depiction of the 68-95-99.7 (or Empirical) Rule on a normal distribution. The 68-95-99.7 Rule is true no matter what  and  are as long as the distribution is normal. For example, if A~N(3,1), then 68% of the individuals will fall between 2 (i.e., 3-1×1) and 4 (i.e., 3+1×1) and 99.7% will fall between 0 (i.e., 3-3×1) and 6 (i.e., 3+3×1). Figure 6.5: Depiction of the 68-95-99.7 (or Empirical) Rule on a A~N(3,1) distribution. Alternatively, if B~N(9,3), then 68% of the individuals will fall between 6 (i.e., 9-1×3) and 12 (i.e., 9+1×3) and 95% will be between 3 (i.e., 9-2×3) and 15 (i.e., 9+2×3). Similar calculations can be made for any normal distribution. Figure 6.6: Depiction of the 68-95-99.7 (or Empirical) Rule on a A~N(9,3) distribution. The 68-95-99.7 Rule is used to find areas under the normal curve as long as the value of interest is an integer number of standard deviations away from the mean. For example, the proportion of individuals that have a value of A greater than 5 (Figure 6.7) is found by first realizing that 95% of the individuals on this distribution fall between 1 and 5 (i.e., ±2 from ). By subtraction this means that 5% of the individuals must be less than 1 AND greater than 5. Finally, because normal distributions are symmetric, the same percentage of individuals must be less than 1 as are greater than 5. Thus, half of 5%, or 2.5%, of the individuals have a value of A greater than 5. Figure 6.7: The N(3,1) distribution depicting how the 68-95-99.7 Rule is used to compute the percentage of individuals with values greater than 5. The 68-95-99.7 Rule can only be used for questions involving integer standard deviations away from the mean. 6.4 Example Calculations Suppose, for example, that the total miles driven per week by a particular person is normally distributed with a mean of 160 miles and a standard deviation of 25 miles. The following questions can be answered for this situation using the 68-95-99.7% Rule. What percentage of weeks does the driver drive less than 110 miles? 2.5%  110 is exactly 2 standard deviations below the mean (i.e., 160-2×25=110). The area between 2 standard deviations above and below the mean is 95%, so there is 5% outside of those two points. We want only one side of this symmetric distribution, so 5% is split in half to get 2.5%. What percentage of weeks does the driver drive less than 185 miles? 84%  185 is exactly 1 standard deviation above the mean (i.e., 160+1×25). The area between 1 standard deviation above and below the mean is 68%, so there is 32% outside of those two points with 16% in each tail. Thus, the area less than 185 is 68%+16%=84%. What percentage of weeks does the driver drive between 135 and 210 miles? 81.5%  135 miles is exactly 1 standard deviation below the mean (i.e., 160-1×25=135) and thus has 16% of the area below it. 210 miles is exactly 2 standard deviations above the mean (i.e., 160+2×25=210) and thus has 2.5% of the area above. To get the area between 135 and 210, subtract these combined areas from 100. The following questions, though they sound different, can also be answered with the 68-95-99.7% Rule. What are the miles driven for the highest 16% of miles driven? 185  Hopefully the 16% sounds familiar from above, which relates it to one tail left over from 68%. The question is looking for the highest 16% so it is the upper tail that starts exactly one standard deviation above the mean (i.e., 160+1×25=185). What are the miles driven for the lowest 2.5% of miles driven? 110  Hopefully the 2.5% sounds familiar from above, which relates it to one tail left over from 95%. The question is looking for the lowest 2.5% so it is the lower tail that starts exactly two standard deviations below the mean (i.e., 160-2×25=110). What are the most common 68% of miles driven? Between 135 and 185  This is simply the first part of the 68-95-99.7% Rule. See the previous plots with 68%. 6.5 Distinguish Calculation Types It is critical to be able to distinguish between two main types of calculations made from normal distributions. The first type of calculation is when you are given a value of the variable (X) and asked to find a percentage of individuals. These questions are called forward questions. The first three questions in the examples of the previous section are forward calculations because the questions gave you miles driven per week values and asked you to find a percentage of weeks. The second type of calculation occurs when you are given a percentage and asked to find the value (or values) of the variable related to that percentage. These calculations are called reverse questions simply to contrast them with the previous forward calculations. The last three questions in the examples of the previous section are reverse calculations because the questions gave you a percentage of weeks and asked you to find a miles driven per week value. Distinguishing between these two types of calculations (Table 6.1) is a matter of deciding if (i) the value of the variable is given and the percentage (or area) is to be found or (ii) if the percentage (or area) is given and the value of the variable is to be found. Therefore, distinguishing between the calculation types is as simple as identifying what is given (or known) and what must be found. If the value of the variable is given but not the percentage then a forward calculation is used. If the percentage is given then a reverse calculation to find the value of the variable is used. Table 6.1: What is given (or known) and what you are asked to find for Forward and Reverse normal disribution questions. Question Type Given (Know) Asked to Find Forward Value (X) Percentage (area) Reverse Percentage (area) Value (X) In addition to categorizing the question as a Forward or Reverse question, we will also categorize it as a Left-of, Right-of, or Between question based on which way is shaded to mark the area on the normal distribution. So for each question we can categorize as one of six possibilities  Forward-Left, Forward-Right, Forward-Between, Reverse-Left, Reverse-Right, or Reverse-Between. All of the questions from the previous section are shown below and marked as to what type of question they are. What percentage of weeks does the driver drive less than 110 miles? Forward-Left (given a value of X, shaded to the left) What percentage of weeks does the driver drive less than 185 miles? Forward-Left (given a value of X, shaded to the left) What percentage of weeks does the driver drive between 135 and 210 miles? Forward-Between (given two values of X, shaded between them) What are the miles driven for the highest 16% of miles driven? Reverse-Right (given a percentage, shaded to the right) What are the miles driven for the lowest 2.5% of miles driven? Reverse-Left (given a percentage, shaded to the left) What are the most common 68% of miles driven? Reverse-Between (given a percentage, shaded the middle between two values) See Module 11. "],["NormalDist2.html", "Module 7 Normal Distribution Calculations 7.1 Forward Calculations 7.2 Reverse Calculations 7.3 Example Calculations 7.4 Standardization and Z-Scores", " Module 7 Normal Distribution Calculations The normal distribution was introduced in Module 6 and the 68-95-99.7% Rule was used to find the percentage of individuals with particular values of the variable (i.e., a forward calculation) or to find the value or values of the variable with a certain percentage of individuals (i.e., a reverse calculation). Unfortunately, the 68-95-99.7% Rule can only be used if the value (or values) in the question fall exactly 1, 2, or 3 standard deviations away from the mean. In other words, questions relative to non-integer numbers of standard deviations away from the mean can not be found with the 68-95-99.7% Rule and will require special tables or computer software. In this course, we will use a function from the NCStats package in R to perform these calculations. How you use this function depends on whether it is a forward or reverse calculation (see Section 6.5). 7.1 Forward Calculations The area under a normal curve relative to a particular value is computed in R with distrib(), with the particular value as the first argument and the mean () and standard deviation () of the normal distribution in the mean= and sd= arguments, respectively. The distrib() function defaults to finding the area to the left of the particular value; it can find the area to the right of the particular value by including lower.tail=FALSE. For example, suppose that the heights of a population of students is known to be H~N(66,3). The proportion of students in this population that have a height less than 71 inches is with ( distrib(71,mean=66,sd=3) ) which produces Figure 7.1. Thus, approximately 95.2% of students in this population have a height less than 71 inches. Figure 7.1: Calculation of the proportion of individuals on a \\(N(66,3)\\) with a value less than 71. The proportion of students in this population that have a height greater than 68 inches is computed with (note use of lower.tail=FALSE) ( distrib(68,mean=66,sd=3,lower.tail=FALSE) ) which produces Figure 7.2. Thus, approximately 25.2% of students in this population have a height greater than 68 inches. Figure 7.2: Calculation of the proportion of individuals on a \\(N(66,3)\\) with a value greater than 68. If a question is a Forward-Right then you must include lower.tail=FALSE in distrib(). Finding the area between two particular values is a bit more work. To answer between-type questions, the area less than the smaller of the two values is subtracted from the area less than the larger of the two values. This is illustrated by noting that two values split the area under the normal curve into three parts  A, B, and C in Figure 7.3. The area between the two values is B. The area to the left of the larger value corresponds to the area A+B. The area to the left of the smaller value corresponds to the area A. Thus, subtracting the latter from the former leaves the in-between area B (i.e., (A+B)-A = B). Figure 7.3: Schematic representation of how to find the area between two \\(Z\\) values. For example, the area between 62 and 70 inches of height is found below. Thus, 81.8% of students in this population have a height between 62 and 70 inches. ( AB &lt;- distrib(70,mean=66,sd=3) ) # left-of 70 ( A &lt;- distrib(62,mean=66,sd=3) ) # left-of 62 AB-A # between 62 and 70 #R&gt; [1] 0.8175776 Figure 7.4: Calculation of the areas less than 70 inches (Left) and 62 inches (Right). The area between two values is found by subtracting the area less than the smaller value from the area less than the larger value. 7.2 Reverse Calculations Reverse questions also use distrib(), though the first argument is now the given percentage, though it must be entered as a proportion. The calculation is treated as a reverse question only when type=\"q\" is also given to distrib().32 For example, the height that has 20% of all students shorter is computed with ( distrib(0.20,mean=66,sd=3,type=&quot;q&quot;) ) which produces Figure 7.5. Thus, the shortest 20% of students are less than 63.5 inches tall. Figure 7.5: Calculation of the height with 20% of all students shorter. Greater than reverse questions are computed by also including lower.tail=FALSE. For example, the tallest 10% of the population of students is computed with ( distrib(0.10,mean=66,sd=3,type=&quot;q&quot;,lower.tail=FALSE) ) which produces Figure 7.6. Thus, the tallest 10% of students are taller than 69.8 inches. Figure 7.6: Calculation of the height with 10% of all students taller. For Reverse normal distribution questions you MUST use type=\"q\" in distrib(). If the question is a Reverse-Right then you must also include lower.tail=FALSE in distrib(). Between questions can only be easily handled if the question is looking for endpoint values that are symmetric about . In other words, the question must ask for the two values that contain the most common proportion of individuals. For example, suppose that you were asked to find the most common 80% of heights. This type of question is handled by converting this symmetric between question into two less than questions. For example, in Figure 7.7 the area D is the symmetric area of interest. If D is 0.80, then C+E must be 0.20.33 Because D is symmetric about , C and E must both equal 0.10. Thus, the lower bound on D is the value that has 10% of all values smaller. Similarly, because the combined area of C and D is 0.90, the upper bound on D is the value that has 90% of all values smaller. This question has now been converted from a symmetric between to two less than questions that can be answered exactly as shown above. Figure 7.7: Depiction of areas in a reverse between type normal distribution question. For example, the two heights that have a symmetric 80% of individuals between them are 62.2 and 69.8 as computed below. ( distrib(0.10,mean=66,sd=3,type=&quot;q&quot;) ) ( distrib(0.90,mean=66,sd=3,type=&quot;q&quot;) ) Figure 7.8: Calculations for the two values with an area of 80% between them. For Reverse-Between questions you must convert the symmetric between area to two left-of areas and then perform two Reverse-Left questions with those areas. 7.3 Example Calculations Suppose (as in Section 6.4) that the total miles driven per week by a particular person is normally distributed with a mean of 160 miles and a standard deviation of 25 miles. Use this information to answer the following questions. What percentage of weeks does the driver drive more than 125 miles? 91.9%  This is a Forward-Right question because a value of X is given and we should shade to the right (i.e., more than). This percentage is computed with ( distrib(125,mean=160,sd=25,lower.tail=FALSE) ) What is the miles driven for the 25% of weeks with the fewest miles driven? Less than 143.1 miles  This is a Reverse-Left question because a percentage is given and we should shade to the left (i.e., fewest). This value is computed with ( distrib(0.25,mean=160,sd=25,type=&quot;q&quot;) ) What is the miles driven for the 5% of weeks with the most miles driven? More than 201.1 miles  This is a Reverse-Right question because a percentage is given and we should shade to the right (i.e., most). This value is computed with ( distrib(0.05,mean=160,sd=25,type=&quot;q&quot;,lower.tail=FALSE) ) What percentage of weeks does the driver drive between 75 and 100 miles? 0.8%  This is a Forward-Between question because two values of X are given and we should shade between the two values. This percentage is computed by finding the difference of the two areas provided from the following ( AB &lt;- distrib(100,mean=160,sd=25) ) ( A &lt;- distrib(75,mean=160,sd=25) ) AB-A What is the most common 60% of miles driven? Between 139.0 and 181.0 miles  This is a Reverse-between question because a percentage is given and we should shade in between (i.e., most common). These values are computed with ( distrib(0.2,mean=160,sd=25,type=&quot;q&quot;) ) ( distrib(0.8,mean=160,sd=25,type=&quot;q&quot;) ) 7.4 Standardization and Z-Scores An individual that is 59 inches tall is 7 inches shorter than average if heights are N(66,3). Is this a large or a small difference? Alternatively, this same individual is \\(\\frac{-7}{3}\\) = -2.33 standard deviations below the mean. Thus, a height of 59 inches is relatively rare in this population because few individuals are more than two standard deviations away from the mean.34 As seen here, the relative magnitude that an individual differs from the mean is better expressed as the number of standard deviations that the individual is away from the mean. Values are standardized by changing the original scale (inches in this example) to one that counts the number of standard deviations (i.e., ) that the value is away from the mean (i.e., ). For example, with the height variable above, 69 inches is one standard deviation above the mean, which corresponds to +1 on the standardized scale. Similarly, 60 inches is two standard deviations below the mean, which corresponds to -2 on the standardized scale. Finally, 67.5 inches on the original scale is one half standard deviation above the mean or +0.5 on the standardized scale. The process of computing the number of standard deviations that an individual is away from the mean is called standardizing. Standardizing is accomplished with \\[ \\text{Z} = \\frac{``\\text{value&quot;}-``\\text{center&quot;}}{``\\text{dispersion&quot;}} \\] or, more specifically, \\[ \\text{Z} = \\frac{\\text{x}-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\] For example, the standardized value of an individual with a height of 59 inches is Z=\\(\\frac{59-66}{3}\\)=-2.33. Thus, this individuals height is 2.33 standard deviations below the average height in the population. Standardized values (Z) follow a N(0,1). Thus, N(0,1) is called the standard normal distribution. The relationship between X and Z is one-to-one meaning that each value of X converts to one and only one value of Z. This means that the area to the left of X on a N(,) is the same as the area to the left of Z on a N(0,1). This one-to-one relationship is illustrated in Figure 7.9 using the individual with a height of 59 inches and Z=-2.33. Figure 7.9: Plots depicting the area to the left of 59 on a N(66,3) (Left) and the area to the right of the corresponding Z-score of Z=-2.33 on a N(0,1) (Right). Note that the x-axis scales are different. The standardized scale (i.e., z-scores) represents the number of standard deviations that a value is from the mean. q stands for quantile. Because all three areas must sum to 1. From the 68-95-99.7% Rule.

For example, you may measure (i) the height and weight of students in class, (ii) depth and area of a lake, (iii) gender and age of welfare recipients, or (iv) number of mice and biomass of legumes in fields. This module is focused on describing the bivariate relationship between two quantitative variables. Bivariate relationships between two categorical variables is described in Module 10. Data on the weight (lbs) and highway miles per gallon (HMPG) for 93 cars from the 1993 model year are used as an example throughout this module. Ultimately, the relationship between highway MPG and the weight of a car is described. A sample of these data are shown below. Table 8.1: Sample data from 1993 cars data set. MFG Model Type CMPG HMPG Weight Cyls Acura Integra Small 25 31 2705 4 Acura Legend Midsize 18 25 3560 6 Audi 90 Compact 20 26 3375 6 Volkswagen Corrado Sporty 18 25 2810 6 Volvo 240 Compact 21 28 2985 4 Volvo 850 Midsize 20 28 3245 5 8.1 Response and Explanatory Variables The response variable is the variable that one is interested in explaining something (i.e., variability) or in making future predictions about. The explanatory variable is the variable that may help explain or allow one to predict the response variable. In general, the response variable is thought to depend on the explanatory variable. Thus, the response variable is often called the dependent variable, whereas the explanatory variable is often called the independent variable. One may identify the response variable by determining which of the two variables most likely depends on the other. For example, in the car data, highway MPG is the response variable because gas mileage is most likely affected by the weight of the car (e.g., hypothesize that heavier cars get worse gas mileage), rather than vice versa. In some situations it is not obvious which variable is the response. For example, does the number of mice in the field depend on the number of legumes (lots of food=lots of mice) or the other way around (lots of mice=not much food left)? Similarly, does area depend on depth or does depth depend on area of the lake? In these situations, the context of the research question is needed to identify the response variable. For example, if the researcher hypothesized that number of mice will be greater if there are more legumes, then number of mice is the response variable. In many cases, the more difficult variable to measure will likely be the response variable. For example, researchers likely wish to predict area of a lake (hard to measure) from depth of the lake (easy to measure). Which variable is the response may depend on the context of the research question. 8.2 Summaries 8.2.1 Scatterplots A scatterplot is a graph where each point simultaneously represents the values of both the quantitative response and quantitative explanatory variable. The value of the explanatory variable gives the x-coordinate and the value of the response variable gives the y-coordinate of the point plotted for an individual. For example, the first individual in the cars data is plotted at x (Weight) = 2705 and y (HMPG) = 31, whereas the second individual is at x = 3560 and y = 25 (Figure 8.1). Figure 8.1: Scatterplot between the highway MPG and weight of cars manufactured in 1993. For reference to the main text, the first individual is red and the second individual is blue. 8.2.2 Correlation Coefficient The sample correlation coefficient, abbreviated as r, is calculated with \\[ \\text{r} = \\frac{\\sum_{\\text{i}=1}^{n}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\text{x}_{\\text{i}}-\\bar{\\text{x}}}{\\text{s}_{\\text{x}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\text{y}_{\\text{i}}-\\bar{\\text{y}}}{\\text{s}_{\\text{y}}}\\right)\\right]}{\\text{n}-1} \\] where sx and sy are the sample standard deviations for the explanatory and response variables, respectively.35 The formulae in the two sets of parentheses in the numerator are standardized values; thus, the value in each parenthesis is called the standardized x or standardized y, respectively. Using this terminology, the equation for r reduces to these steps: For each individual, standardize x and standardize y.36 For each individual, find the product of the standardized x and standardized y. Sum all of the products from step 2. Divide the sum from step 3 by n-1. Table 8.2 illustrates these calculations for the first five individuals in the cars data.37 Note that the i column is an index for each individual, the xi and yi columns are the observed values of the two variables for individual i, \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) was computed by dividing the sum of the xi column by n, sx was computed by dividing the sum of the (xi-\\(\\bar{\\text{x}})\\)2 column by n-1 and taking the square root, and the std x column are the standardized x values found by dividing the values in the xi-\\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) column by sx. Similar calculations were made for the y variable. The final correlation coefficient is the sum of the last column divided by n-1. Thus, the correlation between car weight and highway mpg for these five cars is -0.54.

All four of these items can be described from a scatterplot. However, for linear relationships, strength is best described from the correlation coefficient. 8.3.1 Form and Outliers The form of a relationship is determined by whether the cloud of points on a scatterplot forms a line or some sort of curve (Figure 8.4). For the purposes of this introductory course, if the cloud appears linear then the form will be said to be linear, whereas if the cloud is curved then the form will be nonlinear. Scatterplots should be considered linear unless there is an OBVIOUS curvature in the points. Figure 8.2: Depictions of two linear and one nonlinear relationship. A smoother is shown to highlight the general form of the relationship. An outlier is a point that is far removed from the main cluster of points (Figure 8.3). Keep in mind (as always) that just because a point is an outlier doesnt mean it is wrong. Figure 8.3: Depiction of an outlier (red point) in an otherwise linear scatterplot. 8.3.2 Association or Direction A positive association is when the scatterplot resembles an increasing function (i.e., increases from lower-left to upper-right; Figure 8.4-Left). For a positive association, most of the individuals are above average or below average for both of the variables. A negative association is when the scatterplot looks like a decreasing function (i.e., decreases from upper-left to lower-right; Figure 8.4-Right). For a negative association, most of the individuals are above average for one variable and below average for the other variable. No association is when the scatterplot looks like a shotgun blast of points (Figure 8.4-Center). For no association, there is no tendency for individuals to be above or below average for one variable and above or below average for the other variable. Figure 8.4: Depiction of three types of association present in scatterplots. Dashed vertical lines are at the means of each variable. 8.3.3 Strength (and Association, Again) Strength is a summary of how closely the points cluster around the general form of the relationship. For example, if a linear form exists, then strength is how closely the points cluster around the line. Strength is difficult to define from a scatterplot because it is a relative term. However, the correlation coefficient (r; Section 8.2.2) is a measure of strength and association between two variables, if the form is linear. To better understand how r is a measure of association and strength, reconsider the steps in calculating r from Section 8.2.2. The scatterplots in Figure 8.5 represent different associations. These scatterplots have dashed lines at the mean of both the x- and y-axis variables. Because the mean is subtracted from observed values when standardizing, points that fall above the mean will have positive standardized values and points that fall below the mean will have negative standardized values. The sign for the standardized values are depicted along the axes. Figure 8.5: Scatterplot with mean lines (dashed lines) and the signs of standardized values for both x and y shown for different associations. Blue points have a positive product of standardized values, whereas red points have a negative product of standardized values. Now consider the product of standardized xs and ys in each quadrant of the scatterplots in Figure 8.5. The product of standardized values is positive (blue points) in the quadrant where both standardized values are above average (i.e., both positive signs) and both are below average. The product of standardized values is negative (red points) in the other two quadrants. Thus, for a positive association (Figure 8.5-Left) the numerator of the correlation coefficient is positive because it is the sum of many positive (blue points) and few negative (red points) products of standardized values. Therefore, r for a positive association is positive (because the denominator of n-1 is always positive). Conversely, for a negative association (Figure 8.5-Right) the numerator of the correlation coefficient is negative because it is the sum of few positive (blue points) and many negative (red points) products of standardized values. Therefore, r for a negative association is negative. Correlations range from -1 to 1. Absolute values of r equal to 1 indicate a perfect association (i.e., all points exactly on a line). A correlation of 0 indicates no association. Thus, absolute values of r near 1 indicate strong relationships and those near 0 are weak. How strength and association of the relationship change along the range of r values is illustrated in Figure 8.6. Guidelines in Table 8.3 can be used to describe the strength of relationship between two variables. Figure 8.6: Scatterplots along the continuum of r values. Table 8.3: Classifications of strength of relationship for absolute values of r by type of study. Statement Observational (Uncontrolled) Experimental (Controlled) Strong &gt;0.8 &gt;0.98 Moderate &gt;0.6 &gt;0.95 Weak &gt;0.4 &gt;0.9 None &lt;0.4 &lt;0.9 8.4 Example Interpretations When performing a bivariate EDA for two quantitative variables, the form, presence (or absence) of outliers, association, and strength should be specifically addressed. In addition, you should state how you assessed strength. Specifically, you should use r to assess strength (see Section 8.3.3) IF the relationship is linear without any outliers. However, if the relationship is nonlinear, has outliers, or both, then strength should be subjectively assessed from the scatterplot. Two other points should be considered when performing a bivariate EDA with quantitative variables. First, if outliers are present, do not let them completely influence your conclusions about form, association, and strength. In other words, assess these items ignoring the outlier(s). If you have raw data and the form excluding the outlier is linear, then compute r with the outlier eliminated from the data. Second, the form of weak relationships is difficult to describe because, by definition, there is very little clustering to a form. As a rule-of-thumb, if the scatterplot is not obviously curved, then it is described as linear by default. Outliers should not influence the descriptions of association, strength, and form. The form is linear unless there is an OBVIOUS curvature. Finally, in the examples below note that 1) form, outliers, association, and strength are specifically assessed in each; 2) strength is assessed from the correlation coefficient (and Table 8.3) only if the form is linear and there are no outliers, 3) the position of outliers is specifically identified, and 4) how whether strength was assessed from the correlation coefficient or not was described. Highway MPG and Weight The following overall bivariate summary for the relationship between highway MPG and weight is made using the scatterplot (Figure 8.1) and correlation coefficient from the previous sections. The relationship between highway MPG and weight of cars appears to be slightly nonlinear (a slight concavity is apparent), negative, and moderately strong. The three points at (2400,46), (2500,27), and (1800,33) might be considered SLIGHT outliers (these are not far enough removed for me to consider them outliers, but some people may). The correlation coefficient was not used to assess strength because I deemed the relationship to be nonlinear. State Energy Usage A 2001 report from the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy details the total consumption of a variety of energy sources by state in 2001. Construct a proper EDA for the relationship between total petroleum and coal consumption (in trillions of BTU). Figure 8.7: Scatterplot of the total consumption of petroleum versus the consumption of coal (in trillions of BTU) by all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The points shown in the left with total petroleum values greater than 3000 trillion BTU are deleted in the right plot. The relationship between total petroleum and coal consumption is generally linear, with two outliers at total petroleum levels greater than 3000 trillions of BTU, positive, and weak (Figure 8.7-Left). I did not use the correlation coefficient because of the outliers. If the two outliers (Texas and California) are removed then the relationship is linear, with no additional outliers, positive, and weak (r=0.53) (Figure 8.7-Right). Hatch Weight and Incubation Time of Geckos A hobbyist hypothesized that there would be a positive association between length of incubation (days) and hatchling weight (grams) for Crested Geckos (Rhacodactylus ciliatus). To test this hypothesis she collected the incubation time and weight for 21 hatchlings with the results shown below. Construct a proper EDA for the relationship between incubation time and hatchling weight. Figure 8.8: Scatterplot of hatchling weight versus incubation time for Crested Geckos. The relationship between hatchling weight and incubation time for the Crested Geckos is linear, without obvious outliers (though some may consider the small hatchling at 60 days to be an outlier), without a definitive association, and weak (r=0.11) (Figure 8.8). I did compute r because no outliers were present and the relationship was linear (or, at least, it was not nonlinear). 8.5 Cautions About Correlation Examining relationships between pairs of quantitative variables is common practice. Using r can be an important part of this analysis, as described above. However, r can be abused through misapplication and misinterpretation. Thus, it is important to remember the following characteristics of correlation coefficients: Variables must be quantitative (i.e., if you cannot make a scatterplot, then you cannot calculate r). The correlation coefficient only measures strength of LINEAR relationships (i.e., if the form of the relationship is not linear, then r is meaningless and should not be calculated). The units that the variables are measured in do not matter (i.e., r is the same between heights and weights measured in inches and lbs, inches and kg, m and kg, cm and kg, and cm and inches). This is because the variables are standardized when calculating r. The distinction between response and explanatory variables is not needed to compute r. That is, the correlation of GPA and ACT scores is the same as the correlation of ACT scores and GPA. Correlation coefficients are between -1 and 1. Correlation coefficients are strongly affected by outliers (simply, because both the mean and standard deviation, used in the calculation of r, are strongly affected by outliers). Additionally, correlation is not causation! In other words, just because a strong correlation is observed it does not mean that the explanatory variable caused the response variable (an exception may be in carefully designed experiments). For example, it was found above that highway gas mileage decreased linearly as the weight of the car increased. One must be careful here to not state that increasing the weight of the car CAUSED a decrease in MPG because these data are part of an observational study and several other important variables were not considered in the analysis. For example, the scatterplot in Figure 8.9, coded for different numbers of cylinders in the cars engine, indicates that the number of cylinders may be inversely related to highway MPG and positively related to weight of the car. So, does the weight of the car, the number of cylinders, or both, explain the decrease in highway MPG? Figure 8.9: Scatterplot between the highway MPG and weight of cars manufactured in 1993 separated by number of cylinders. More interesting examples that further demonstrate that correlation is not causation can be found on the Spurious Correlations website (e.g., high correlation between number of people who drowned by falling into a pool and the annual number of films that Nicolas Cage appeared in). Finally, the word correlation is often misused in everyday language. Correlation should only be used when discussing the actual correlation coefficient (i.e., r). When discussing the association between two variables, one should use association or relationship rather than correlation. For example, one might ask What is the relationship between age and rate of cancer? but should not ask (unless specifically interested in r) What is the correlation between age and rate of cancer? See Section 4.1.1.4 for a review of standard deviations. See Section 7.4 for a review of standardized values. The five cars are treated as if they are the entire sample.

Examples include predicting future sales of a product from its price, family expenditures on recreation from family income, an animals food consumption in relation to ambient temperature, and a persons score on a German assessment test based on how many years the person studied German. Exact predictions cannot be made because of natural variability. For example, two people with the same intake of mercury (from consumption of fish) will likely not have the same level of mercury in their blood stream. Thus, the best that can be accomplished is to predict the average or expected value for a person with a particular intake value. This is accomplished by finding the line that best fits the points on a scatterplot of the data and using that line to make predictions. Finding and using the best-fit line is the topic of this module. 9.1 Response and Explanatory Variables Recall from Section 8.1 that the response (or dependent) variable is the variable to be predicted or explained and the explanatory (or independent) variable is the variable that will help do the predicting or explaining. In the examples mentioned above, future sales, family expenditures on recreation, the animals food consumption, and score on the assessment test are response variables and product price, family income, temperature, and years studying German are explanatory variables, respectively. The response variable is on the y-axis and the explanatory variable is on the x-axis of scatterplots. 9.2 Slope and Intercept The equation of a line is commonly expressed as, \\[ y = m\\times x + b \\] where both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are variables, \\(m\\) represents the slope of the line, and \\(b\\) represents the y-intercept.38 It is important that you can look at the equation of a line and identify the response variable, explanatory variable, slope, and intercept. The response variable will always appear by itself on the left side of the equation. The explanatory variable (e.g., \\(x\\)) will be on the right side of the equation and will be multiplied by the slope. The value or symbol by itself on the right side of the equation is the intercept. For example, in \\[ \\text{blood} = 0.579\\times\\text{intake}+3.501 \\] blood is the response variable, intake is the explanatory variable, 0.579 is the slope (it is multiplied by the explanatory variable), and 3.501 is the intercept (it is not multiplied by anything on the right side). The same conclusions would be made if the equation had been written as \\[ \\text{blood} = 3.501 + 0.579\\times\\text{intake} \\] In the equation of a line, the slope is always multiplied by the explanatory variable and the intercept is always by itself. In addition to being able to identify the slope and intercept of a line you also need to be able to interpret these values. Most students define the slope as rise over run and the intercept as where the line crosses the y-axis. These definitions are loose geometric representations. For our purposes, the slope and intercept must be more strictly defined. To define the slope, first think of plugging two values of intake into the equation discussed above. For example, if intake=100, then blood=3.501+0.579×100=61.401 and if intake is one unit larger at 101, then blood=3.501+0.579×101=61.980.39 The difference between these two values is 61.980-61.401=0.579, which is the same as the slope. Thus, the slope is the change in the AVERAGE value of the response variable FOR A SINGLE UNIT CHANGE in the value of the explanatory variable (Figure 9.1). That is, mercury in the blood changes 0.579 units FOR A SINGLE UNIT CHANGE in mercury intake, ON AVERAGE. So, if an individual increases mercury intake by one unit, then mercury in the blood will increase by 0.579 units, ON AVERAGE. Alternatively, if one individual has one more unit of mercury intake than another individual, then the first individual will have 0.579 more units of mercury in their blood, ON AVERAGE. Figure 9.1: Schematic representation of the meaning of the intercept and slope in a linear equation. To define the intercept, first plug intake=0 into the equation discussed above; i.e., blood=3.501+0.579×0 = 3.501. Thus, the intercept is the value of the response variable when the explanatory variable is equal to zero (Figure 9.1). In this example, the AVERAGE mercury in the blood for an individual with no mercury intake is 3.501. Many times, as is true with this example, the interpretation of the intercept will be nonsensical. This is because x=0 will likely be outside the range of the data collected and, perhaps, outside the range of possible data that could be collected. The equation of the line is a model for the relationship depicted in a scatterplot. Thus, the interpretations for the slope and intercept represent the average change or the average response variable. Thus, whenever a slope or intercept is being interpreted it must be noted that the result is an average or on average. 9.3 Predictions Once a best-fit line has been identified (criteria for doing so is discussed in Section 9.5), the equation of the line can be used to predict the average value of the response variable for individuals with a particular value of the explanatory variable. For example, the best-fit line for the mercury data shown in Figure 9.2 is \\[ \\text{blood} = 3.501 + 0.579\\times\\text{intake} \\] Thus, the predicated average level of mercury in the blood for an individual that consumed 240 ug HG/day is found with \\[ \\text{blood} = 3.501 + 0.579\\times240 = 142.461 \\] Similarly, the predicted average level of mercury in the blood for an individual that consumed 575 ug HG/day is found with \\[ \\text{blood} = 3.501 + 0.579\\times575 = 336.426 \\] A prediction may be visualized by finding the value of the explanatory variable on the x-axis, drawing a vertical line until the best-fit line is reached, and then drawing a horizontal line over to the y-axis where the value of the response variable is read (Figure 9.2). Figure 9.2: Scatterplot between the intake of mercury in fish and the mercury in the blood stream of individuals with superimposed best-fit regression line illustrating predictions for two values of mercury intake. When predicting values of the response variable, it is important to not extrapolate beyond the range of the data. In other words, predictions with values outside the range of observed values of the explanatory variable should be made cautiously (if at all). An excellent example would be to consider height data collected during the early parts of a humans life (say the first ten years). During these early years there is likely a good fit between height (the response variable) and age. However, using this relationship to predict an individuals height at age 40 would likely result in a ridiculous answer (e.g., over ten feet). The problem here is that the linear relationship only holds for the observed data (i.e., the first ten years of life); it is not known if the same linear relationship exists outside that range of years. In fact, with human heights, it is generally known that growth first slows, eventually quits, and may, at very old ages, actually decline. Thus, the linear relationship found early in life does not hold for later years. Critical mistakes can be made when using a linear relationship to extrapolate outside the range of the data. 9.4 Residuals The predicted value is a best-guess for an individual based on the best-fit line. The actual value for any individual is likely to be different from this predicted value. The residual is a measure of how far off the prediction is from what is actually observed. Specifically, the residual for an individual is found by subtracting the predicted value (given the individuals observed value of the explanatory variable) from the individuals observed value of the response variable, or \\[ \\text{residual}=\\text{observed response}-\\text{predicted response}\\] For example, consider an individual that has an observed intake of 650 and an observed level of mercury in the blood of 480. As shown in the previous section, the predicted level of mercury in the blood for this individual is \\[ \\text{blood} = 3.501 + 0.579\\times650 = 379.851\\] The residual for this individual is then 480-379.851 = 100.149. This positive residual indicates that the observed value is approximately 100 units GREATER than the average for individuals with an intake of 650.40 As a second example, consider an individual with an observed intake of 250 and an observed level of mercury in the blood of 105. The predicted value for this individual is \\[ \\text{blood} = 3.501 + 0.579\\times250 = 148.251\\] and the residual is 105-148.251 = -43.251. This negative residual indicates that the observed value is approximately 43 units LESS than the average for individuals with an intake of 250. Visually, a residual is the vertical distance between an individuals point and the best-fit line (Figure 9.3). Figure 9.3: Scatterplot between the intake of mercury in fish and the mercury in the blood stream of individuals with superimposed best-fit regression line illustrating the residuals for the two individuals discussed in the main text. 9.5 Best-fit Criteria An infinite number of lines can be placed on a graph, but many of those lines do not adequately describe the data. In contrast, many of the lines will appear, to our eye, to adequately describe the data. So, how does one find THE best-fit line from all possible lines. The least-squares method described below provides a quantifiable and objective measure of which line best fits the data. Residuals are a measure of how far an individual is from a candidate best-fit line. Residuals computed from all individuals in a data set measure how far all individuals are from the candidate best-fit line. Thus, the residuals for all individuals can be used to identify the best-fit line. The residual sum-of-squares (RSS) is the sum of all squared residuals. The least-squares criterion says that the best-fit line is the one line out of all possible lines that has the minimum RSS (Figure 9.4). Figure 9.4: Scatterplot with the best-fit line (light gray) and candidate best-fit lines (red line) and residuals (vertical red dashed lines) in the left pane and the residual sum-of-squares for all candidate lines (gray) with the current line highlighted with a red dot. Note how the candidate line is on the best-fit line when the RSS is smallest. The discussion thusfar implies that all possible lines must be fit to the data and the one with the minimum RSS is chosen as the best-fit line. As there are an infinite number of possible lines, this would be impossible to do. Theoretical statisticians have shown that the application of the least-squares criterion always produces a best-fit line with a slope given by \\[ \\text{slope} = \\text{r}\\frac{\\text{s}_{\\text{y}}}{\\text{s}_{\\text{x}}} \\] and an intercept given by \\[ \\text{intercept} = \\bar{\\text{y}}-\\text{slope}\\times\\bar{\\text{x}} \\] where \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) and sx are the sample mean and standard deviation of the explanatory variable, \\(\\bar{\\text{y}}\\) and sy are the sample mean and standard deviation of the response variable, and r is the sample correlation coefficient between the two variables. Thus, using these formulae finds the slope and intercept for the line, out of all possible lines, that minimizes the RSS. 9.6 Assumptions The least-squares method for finding the best-fit line only works appropriately if each of the following five assumptions about the data has been met. A line describes the data (i.e., a linear form). Homoscedasticity. Normally distributed residuals at a given x. Independent residuals at a given x. The explanatory variable is measured without error. While all five assumptions of linear regression are important, only the first two are vital when the best-fit line is being used primarily as a descriptive model for data.41 Description is the primary goal of linear regression used in this course and, thus, only the first two assumptions are considered further. The linearity assumption appears obvious  if a line does not represent the data, then dont try to fit a line to it! Violations of this assumption are evident by a non-linear or curving form in the scatterplot. The homoscedasticity assumption states that the variability about the line is the same for all values of the explanatory variable. In other words, the dispersion of the data around the line must be the same along the entire line. Violations of this assumption generally present as a funnel-shaped dispersion of points from left-to-right on a scatterplot. Violations of these assumptions are often evident on a fitted-line plot, which is a scatterplot with the best-fit line superimposed (Figure 9.5).42 If the points look more-or-less like random scatter around the best-fit line, then neither the linearity nor the homoscedasticity assumption has been violated. A violation of one of these assumptions should be obvious on the scatterplot. In other words, there should be a clear curvature or funneling on the plot. Figure 9.5: Fitted-line plots illustrating when the regression assumptions are met (upper-left) and three common assumption violations. In this course, if an assumption has been violated, then one should not continue to interpret the linear regression. However, in many instances, an assumption violation can be corrected by transforming one or both variables to a different scale. Transformations are not discussed in this course. If the regression assumptions are not met, then the regression results should not be interpreted. 9.7 Coefficient of Determination The coefficient of determination (r2) is the proportion of the total variability in the response variable that is explained away by knowing the value of the explanatory variable and the best-fit model. In simple linear regression, r2 is literally the square of r, the correlation coefficient.43 Values of r2 are between 0 and 1.44 The meaning of r2 can be examined by making predictions of the response variable with and without knowing the value of the explanatory variable. First, consider predicting the value of the response variable without any information about the explanatory variable. In this case, the best prediction is the sample mean of the response variable (represented by the dashed blue horizontal line in Figure 9.6). However, because of natural variability, not all individuals will have this value. Thus, the prediction might be bracketed by predicting that the individual will be between the observed minimum and maximum values (solid blue horizontal lines). Loosely speaking, this range is the total variability in the response variable (blue box). Figure 9.6: Fitted line plot with visual representations of variabilities explained and unexplained. A full explanation is in the main text. Suppose now that the response variable is predicted for an individual with a known value of the explanatory variable (e.g., at the dashed vertical red line in Figure 9.6). The predicted value for this individual is the value of the response variable at the corresponding point on the best-fit line (dashed horizontal red line). Again, because of natural variability, not all individuals with this value of the explanatory variable will have this exact value of the response variable. However, the prediction is now bracketed by the minimum and maximum value of the response variable ONLY for those individuals with the same value of the explanatory variable (solid red horizontal lines). Loosely speaking, this range (red box) is the variability in the response variable remaining after knowing the value of the explanatory variable or the variability in the response variable that cannot be explained away (by the explanatory variable). The portion of the total variability in the response variable that was explained away consists of all the values of the response variable that would no longer be entertained as possible predictions once the value of the explanatory variable is known (green box in Figure 9.6). Now, by its definition, r2 can be visualized as the area of the green box divided by the area of the blue box. This calculation does not depend on which value of the explanatory variable is chosen as long as the data are evenly distributed around the line (i.e., homoscedasticity exists  see Section 9.6). If the variability explained away (green box) approaches the total variability in the response variable (blue box), then r2 approaches 1. This will happen only if the variability around the line approaches zero. In contrast, the variability explained (green box) will approach zero if the slope is zero (i.e., no relationship between the response and explanatory variables). Thus, values of r2 also indicate the strength of the relationship; values near 1 are stronger than values near 0. Values near 1 also mean that predictions will be very precise  i.e., there is little variability remaining after knowing the explanatory variable. A value of r2 near 1 represents a strong relationship between the response and explanatory variables that will lead to precise predictions. 9.8 Examples There are twelve questions that are commonly asked about linear regression results. These twelve questions are listed below with some thoughts about things to remember when answering some of the questions. Example of these questions in a context is then provided. What is the response variable? Identify which variable is to be predicted or explained, which variable is dependent on the other variable, which would be hardest to measure, or which is on the y-axis. What is the explanatory variable? The remaining variable after identifying the response variable. Comment on linearity and homoscedasticity. Examine fitted-line plot for curvature (i.e., non-linearity) or a funnel-shape (i.e., heteroscedasticity). What is the equation of the best-fit line? In the generic equation of the line (y=m×x+b) replace y with the name of the response variable, x with the name of the explanatory variable, m with the value of the slope, and b with the value of the intercept. Interpret the value of the slope. Comment on how the response variable changes by the slope amount for each one unit change of the explanatory variable, on average. Interpret the value of the intercept. Comment on how the response variable equals the intercept, on average, if the explanatory variable is zero. Make a prediction given a value of the explanatory variable. Plug the given value of the explanatory variable into the equation of the best-fit line. Make sure that this is not an extrapolation. Compute a residual given values of both the explanatory and response variables. Make a prediction (see previous question) and then subtract this value from the observed value of the response. Make sure that the prediction is not an extrapolation. Identify an extrapolation in the context of a prediction problem. Examine the x-axis scale on the fitted-line plot and do not make predictions outside of the plotted range. What is the proportion of variability in the response variable explained by knowing the value of the explanatory variable? This is r2. What is the correlation coefficient? This is the square root of r2. Make sure to put a negative sign on the result if the slope is negative. How much does the response variable change if the explanatory variable changes by X units? This is an alternative to asking for an interpretation of the slope. If the explanatory variable changes by X units, then the response variable will change by X×slope units, on average. All interpretations should be in terms of the variables of the problem rather than the generic terms of x, y, response variable, and explanatory variable. Questions about the slope, intercept, and predictions need to explicitly identify that the answer is an average or on average. Chimp Hunting Parties Stanford (1996) gathered data to determine if the size of the hunting party (number of individuals hunting together) affected the hunting success of the party (percent of hunts that resulted in a kill) for wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) at Gombe. The results of their analysis for 17 hunting parties is shown in the figure below.45 Use these results to answer the questions below. What is the response variable? The response variable is the percent of successful hunts because the authors are attempting to see if success depends on hunting party size. Additionally, the percent of successful hunts is shown on the y-axis. What is the explanatory variable? The explanatory variable is the size of the hunting party. Comment on linearity and homoscedasticity. The data appear to be very slightly curved but there is no evidence of a funnel-shape. Thus, the data may be slightly non-linear but they appear homoscedastic. In terms of the variables of the problem, what is the equation of the best-fit line? The equation of the best-fit line is % Success of Hunt = 24.21 + 3.71×Number of Hunting Party Members. Interpret the value of the slope in terms of the variables of the problem. The slope indicates that the percent of successful hunts increases by 3.71, on average, for every increase of one member to the hunting party. Interpret the value of the intercept in terms of the variables of the problem. The intercept indicates that the percent of successful hunts is 24.21, on average, for hunting parties with no members. This is nonsensical because 0 hunting members is an extrapolation. What is the predicted hunt success if the hunting party consists of 20 chimpanzees? The predicted hunt success for parties with 20 individuals is an extrapolation, because 20 is outside the range of number of members observed on the x-axis of the fitted-line plot. What is the predicted hunt success if the hunting party consists of 12 chimpanzees? The predicted hunt success for parties with 12 individuals is 24.21 + 3.71×12 = 68.7%. What is the residual if the hunt success for 10 individuals is 50%? The predicted hunt success for 10 indviduals is (24.21 + 3.71×10) = 61.3%. Thus, the residual in this case is 50-61.3 = -11.3. Therefore, it appears that the success of this hunting party is 11.3% lower than average for this size of hunting party. What proportion of the variability in hunting success is explained by knowing the size of the hunting party? The proportion of the variability in hunting success that is explained by knowing the size of the hunting party is r2=0.88. What is the correlation between hunting success and size of hunting party? The correlation between hunting success and size of hunting party is r=0.94. [Note that this is the square root of r2.] How much does hunt success decrease, on average, if there are two fewer individuals in the party? If the hunting party has two fewer members, then the hunting success would decrease by 7.4% (i.e., -2×3.71), on average. [Note that this is two times the slope, with a negative as it asks about fewer members.] Car Weight and MPG In Module 8, an EDA for the relationship between HMPG (the highway miles per gallon) and Weight (lbs) of 93 cars from the 1993 model year was performed. This relationship will be explored further here as an example of a complete regression analysis. The best-fit line question and r2 for these data are shown in Figure 9.7. Figure 9.7: Fitted line plot of the regression of highway MPG on weight of 93 cars from 1993. What is the response variable? The response variable in this analysis is the highway MPG, because that is the variable that we are trying to learn about or explain the variability of. In addition, it is presented on the y-axis of the fitted line plot. What is the explanatory variable? The explanatory variable in this analysis is the weight of the car (by process of elimination). Comment on linearity and homoscedasticity. The simple linear regression model appears to fit the data moderately well as the fitted-line plot (Figure 9.7) shows only a very slight curvature and only very slight heteroscedasticity.46. In terms of the variables of the problem, what is the equation of the best-fit line? The equation of the best-fit line for this problem is HMPG = 51.6 - 0.0073×Weight. Interpret the value of the slope in terms of the variables of the problem. The slope indicates that for every increase of one pound of car weight the highway MPG decreases by 0.0073, on average. Interpret the value of the intercept in terms of the variables of the problem. The intercept indicates that a car with 0 weight will have a highway MPG value of 51.6, on average. [Note that this is the correct interpretation of the intercept. However, it is nonsensical because it is an extrapolation; i.e., no car will weigh 0 pounds.] What is the predicted highway MPG for a car that weighs 3100 lbs? The predicted highway MPG for a car that weighs 3100 lbs is 51.6 - 0.0073×3100 = 29.0 MPG. What is the predicted highway MPG for a car that weighs 5100 lbs? The predicted highway MPG for a car that weighs 5100 lbs should not be computed with the results of this regression, because 5100 lbs is outside the domain of the data (Figure 9.7). What is the residual for a car that weights 3500 lbs and has a highway MPG of 24? The predicted highway MPG for a car that weighs 3500 lbs is 51.6 - 0.0073×3500 = 26.1. Thus, the residual for this car is 24 - 26.1 = -2.1. Therefore, it appears that this car gets 2.1 MPG LESS than an average car with the same weight. What proportion of the variability in highway MPG is explained by knowing the weight of the car? The proportion of the variability in highway MPG that is explained by knowing the weight of the car is r2=0.66. What is the correlation between highway MPG and car weight? The correlation between highway MPG and car weight is r=-0.81. [Not that this is the square root of r2, but as a negative because form of the relationship between highway MPG and weight is negative.] How much is the highway MPG expected to change if a car is 1000 lbs heavier? If the car was 1000 lbs heavier, you would expect the cars highway MPG to decrease by 7.33. [Note that this is 1000 slopes.] Hereafter, simply called the intercept. For simplicity of exposition, the actual units are not used in this discussion. However, units would usually be replaced with the actual units used for the measurements. In other words, the observed value is above the line. In contrast to using the model to make inferences about a population model. Residual plots, not discussed in this text, are another plot that often times is used to better assess assumption violations. Simple linear regression is the fitting of a model with a single explanatory variable and is the only model considered in this module and this course. See Section 8.2.2 for a review of the correlation coefficient. It is common for r2 to be presented as a percentage. These data are in Chimp.csv. In advanced statistics books, objective measures for determining whether there is significant curvature or heteroscedasticity in the data are used. In this book, we will only be concerned with whether there is strong evidence of curvature or heteroscedasticity. There does not seem to be either here.

Each cell in this table contains the frequency of individuals that were in the corresponding levels of each variable. These frequency tables are often converted to percentage tables for ease of summarization and comparison among populations. This module explores the construction and interpretation of two-way frequency and percentage tables. The General Sociological Survey (GSS) is a very large survey that has been administered 25 times since 1972. The purpose of the GSS is to gather data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes. Data from the following two questions on the GSS are used throughout this module. What is your highest degree earned? [choices  less than high school diploma, high school diploma, junior college, bachelors, or graduate; labeled as degree] How willing would you be to accept cuts in your standard of living in order to protect the environment? [choices  very willing, fairly willing, neither willing nor unwilling, not very willing, or not at all willing; labeled as grnsol] An example of these data are shown below. degree grnsol ltHS vwill HS will HS un JC vun grad vun . . . . 10.1 Frequency Tables A common method of summarizing bivariate categorical data is to count individuals that have each combination of levels of the two categorical variables. For example, how many respondents had less than a HS degree and were very willing, how many had a high school degree and were willing, and so on. The count of the number of individuals of each combination is called a frequency. A two-way frequency table (Table 10.1) offers an efficient way to display these frequencies. For example, 40 of the respondents had less than a high school degree and were very willing to take a cut in their standard of living to protect the environment. Similarly, 542 respondents had a high school degree and were willing to cut their standard of living. Table 10.1: Frequency table of respondents highest completed degree (rows) and willingness to cut their standard of living to protect the environment (columns). vwill will neither un vun Sum ltHS 40 145 132 151 178 646 HS 87 542 512 557 392 2090 JC 15 61 64 54 44 238 BS 42 199 179 187 75 682 grad 24 104 83 64 24 299 Sum 208 1051 970 1013 713 3955 The margins of a two-way frequency table may be augmented with row and column totals (as in Table 10.1). Each marginal total represents the distribution of one of the categorical variables, while ignoring the other. The total column represents the distribution of the row variable; in this case, the highest degree completed. The total row represents the distribution of the column variable; in this case, willingness to cut their standard of living to protect the environment. Thus, for example there were 238 respondents whose highest completed degree was junior college and there were 713 respondents who were very unwilling to cut their standard of living to protect the environment. If one variable can be considered as the response, then this variable should form the columns of the frequency table. For example, willingness to cut could be considered the response variable and it was, appropriately, placed as the column variable in Table 10.1. 10.2 Percentage Tables Two-way frequency tables may be converted to percentage tables for ease of comparison between levels of the variables and also between populations. For example, it is difficult to determine from Table 10.1 if respondents with a high school degree are more likely to be very willing to cut their standard of living than respondents with a graduate degree, because there are approximately seven times as many respondents with a high school degree. However, if the frequencies are converted to percentages, then this comparison is easily made. Three types of percentage tables may be constructed from a frequency table. 10.2.1 Total-Percentage Table Each value in a total-percentage table is computed by dividing each cell of the frequency table by the total number of ALL individuals in the frequency table and multiplying by 100. For example, the value in the vwill column and ltHS row of the table-percentage table (Table 10.2) is computed by dividing the value in the vwill column and ltHS row of the frequency table (i.e., 40; Table 10.1) by the Sum of the entire frequency table (i.e., 3955) and multiplying by 100. Table 10.2: Table-percentage table of respondents highest completed degree (rows) and willingness to cut their standard of living to protect the environment (columns). vwill will neither un vun Sum ltHS 1.0 3.7 3.3 3.8 4.5 16.3 HS 2.2 13.7 12.9 14.1 9.9 52.8 JC 0.4 1.5 1.6 1.4 1.1 6.0 BS 1.1 5.0 4.5 4.7 1.9 17.2 grad 0.6 2.6 2.1 1.6 0.6 7.5 Sum 5.3 26.5 24.4 25.6 18.0 99.8 The value in each cell of a total-percentage table is the percentage OF ALL individuals that have the characteristic of that column AND that row. For example, 1.0% of ALL respondents had less than a high school degree AND were very willing to cut their standard of living to protect the environment. In contrast to the interpretations of the row and column-percentage tables below, interpretations from the table-percentages table DOES refer to ALL respondents. 10.2.2 Row-Percentage Table A row-percentage table is computed by dividing each cell of the frequency table by the total in the same row of the frequency table and multiplying by 100 (Table 10.3). For example, the value in the vwill column and ltHS row of the row-percentage table is computed by dividing the value in the vwill column and ltHS row of the frequency table (i.e., 40; Table 10.1) by the Sum of the ltHS row of the frequency table (i.e., 646) and multiplying by 100. Table 10.3: Row-percentage table of respondents highest completed degree (rows) and willingness to cut their standard of living to protect the environment (columns). vwill will neither un vun Sum ltHS 6.2 22.4 20.4 23.4 27.6 100.0 HS 4.2 25.9 24.5 26.7 18.8 100.1 JC 6.3 25.6 26.9 22.7 18.5 100.0 BS 6.2 29.2 26.2 27.4 11.0 100.0 grad 8.0 34.8 27.8 21.4 8.0 100.0 The value in each cell of a row-percentage table is the percentage OF INDIVIDUALS IN THAT ROW that have the characteristic of that column. For example, 6.2% OF RESPONDENTS WITH LESS THAN A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE are very willing to cut their standard of living to protect the environment.47 If the response variable formed the columns, then the row-percentage table allows one to compare percentages in levels of the response (i.e., columns) across groups (i.e., rows). For example, one can see that there is a general decrease in the percentage of respondents that were very unwilling to cut their standard of living to protect the environment as the level of education increased (Table 10.3). 10.2.3 Column-Percentage Table A column-percentage table is computed by dividing each cell of the frequency table by the total in the same column of the frequency table and multiplying by 100 (Table 10.4). For example, the value in the vwill column and ltHS row on the column-percentage table is computed by dividing the value in the vwill column and ltHS row of the frequency table (i.e., 40; Table 10.1) by the Sum of the vwill column of the frequency table (i.e., 208) and multiplying by 100.

For example, 19.2% OF RESPONDENTS WHO WERE ERY WILLING TO CUT THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING had less than a high school degree.48 10.3 Which Table to Use? Determining which table to use comes from applying one simple rule and practicing with several tables. The rule comes from determining if the question restricts the frame of reference to a particular level of one of the variables. If the question does restrict to a particular level, then either the row or column-percentage table that similarly restricts the frame of reference must be used. If a restriction to a particular level is not made, then the total-percentage table is used. For example, consider the question  What percentage of respondents with a bachelors degree were very unwilling to cut their standard of living to protect the environment? This question refers to only respondents with bachelors degrees (i.e.,  of respondents with a bachelors degree ). Thus, the answer is restricted to the BS ROW of the frequency table and, thus, the answer is found in the ROW-percentage table. Therefore, 11.0% of respondents with bachelors degrees were very unwilling to cut their standard of living to protect the environment (Table 10.3). Now consider the question  What percentage of all respondents had a high school degree and were very willing to cut their standard of living? This question does not restrict the frame of reference because it asks  of all respondents . Therefore, from the TOTAL-percentage table (Table 10.2), 2.2% of all respondents had a high school degree and were very willing to cut their standard of living. Also consider this question  What percentage of respondents who were neither willing nor unwilling to cut their standard of living had graduate degrees? This question refers only to respondents in the NEITHER COLUMN (i.e.,  neither willing nor unwilling ) and, thus, the answer will come from the COLUMN-percentage table. Therefore, 8.6% of respondents who were neither willing nor unwilling to cut their standard of living had graduate degrees (Table 10.4). Finally, consider this question  What percentage of all respondents were very willing to cut their standard of living to help the environment? This question has no restrictions, so the total-percentage table would be used. In addition, this question is only concerned with with the COLUMN variable and, thus, the answer will come from the Sum ROW. Therefore, 5.3%, were very willing to cut their standard of living to help the environment. To determine which percentage table to use determine what type of restriction, if any, has been placed on the frame of reference for the question. If a question does not refer to one of the two variables, then the answer will generally come from the marginal distribution (the Sum row or column) of the other variable. 10.4 Example Calculations In early 2021, the United States was deeply divided with respect to political allegiances and was just beginning to combat the COVID-19 virus with three different vaccines. The development of the vaccines had begun during the Donald Trumps presidency, but administration of the vaccine had largely been carried out during the first months of Joseph Bidens presidency. In March 2021, YouGov asked a sample of U.S. adults Thinking about the vaccine rollout in the US, do you believe the Trump administration or the Biden administration deserves more credit? The results for those respondents that identified a political affiliation and had an opinion about which administration deserved credit are shown in Table 10.5. Table 10.5: Frequency table of respondent by political affiliation (rows) and which presidential administration they think deserves more credit for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout (columns). Trump Biden Both Neither Sum Democrat 249 2023 436 187 2895 Republican 2013 230 316 144 2703 Independent 323 313 127 108 871 Sum 2585 2566 879 439 6469 Use these results to answer the following questions. What percent of Democrats believe that Donald Trumps administration deserves credit for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout? Of the 2895 Democrats in the sample, 8.6% believed that Donald Trumps administration deserved credit for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout (=\\(\\frac{249}{2895}\\)×100). What percent of Republicans believe that Joseph Bidens administration deserves credit for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout? Of the 2703 Replublicans in the sample, 8.5% believed that Joseph Bidens administration deserved credit for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout (=\\(\\frac{230}{2703}\\)×100). What percent of those that believe that neither administration deserves credits for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout were Independents? Of the 439 respondent that believed neither administration deserved credit for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, 24.6% were Independents (=\\(\\frac{108}{439}\\)×100). What percent of all respondents were Independents? Of the 6469 respondents in the sample, 13.5% were Independents (=\\(\\frac{871}{6469}\\)×100). What percent of all respondents were Democrats and believed that both administrations deserved credit for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout? Of the 6469 respondents in the sample, 6.7% were Democrats and believed that both administrations deserved credit for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout (=\\(\\frac{436}{6469}\\)×100). This statement must be read carefully. OF THE RESPONDENTS WITH LESS THAN A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE, not of all respondents, 6.2% were very willing to cut their standard of living. Again, read this carefully. OF THE RESPONDENTS WHO WERE VERY WILLING TO CUT THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING, not of all respondents, 19.2% had less than a high school degree. "],["SamplingDist.html", "Module 11 Sampling Distributions 11.1 What is a Sampling Distribution? 11.2 Central Limit Theorem 11.3 Accuracy and Precision", " Module 11 Sampling Distributions Statistical inference is the process of making a conclusion about the parameter of a population based on the statistic computed from a sample. This process is difficult becauses statistics depend on the specific individuals in the sample and, thus, vary from sample to sample. For example, recall from Section 2.2 that the mean length of fish differed among four samples taken from Square Lake. Thus, to make conclusions about the population from the sample, the distribution (i.e., shape, center, and dispersion) of the statistic computed from all possible samples must be understood.49 In this module, the distribution of statistics from all possible samples is explored and generalizations are defined that can be used to make inferences. In subsequent modules, this information, along with results from a single sample, will be used to make specific inferences about the population. Statistical inference requires considering sampling variability. 11.1 What is a Sampling Distribution? 11.1.1 Definitions and Characteristics A Sampling distribution is the distribution of values of a particular statistic computed from all possible samples of the same size from the same population. The discussion of sampling distributions and all subsequent theories related to statistical inference are based on repeated samples from the same population. As these theories are developed, we will consider taking multiple samples; however, after the theories have been developed, then only one sample will be taken with the theory then being applied to those results. Thus, it is important to note that only one sample is ever actually taken from a population. The concept of a sampling distribution is illustrated with a population of six students that scored 6, 6, 4, 5, 7 and 8 points, respectively, on an 8-point quiz. The mean of this population is = 6.000 points and the standard deviation is =1.414 points. Suppose that every sample of size n=2 is extracted from this population and that the sample mean is computed for each sample (Table 11.1).50 Table 11.1: All possible samples of n=2 and corresponding sample mean from the quiz score population. Sample Scores Mean 1 6, 6 6.0 2 6, 4 5.0 3 6, 5 5.5 4 6, 7 6.5 5 6, 8 7.0 6 6, 4 5.0 7 6, 5 5.5 8 6, 7 6.5 9 6, 8 7.0 10 4, 5 4.5 11 4, 7 5.5 12 4, 8 6.0 13 5, 7 6.0 14 5, 8 6.5 15 7, 8 7.5 Again, a sampling distribution shows the values of a statistic from all possible samples. Thus, the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) from samples of n=2 from this population is the histogram of the 15 sample means in Table 11.1 (Figure 11.1).51 Figure 11.1: Sampling distribution of mean quiz scores from samples of n=2 from the quiz score population. The mean (=6.000) and standard deviation (=0.845) of the 15 sample means are measures of center and dispersion for the sampling distribution. The standard deviation of statistics (i.e., dispersion of the sampling distribution) is generally referred to as the standard error of the statistic (abbreviated as SEstat). This new terminology is used to keep the dispersion of the sampling distribution separate from the dispersion of individuals in the population. Thus, the standard deviation of all possible sample means is referred to as the standard error of the sample means (SE\\(_{\\bar{\\text{x}}}\\)), which is 0.845 in this example. The standard deviation is the dispersion of individuals in the population and is 1.414 in this example. This example illustrates three major concepts concerning sampling distributions. First, the sampling distribution will more closely resemble a normal distribution than the original population distribution (unless, of course, the original population distribution was normal). Second, the center (i.e., mean) of the sampling distribution will equal the parameter that the statistic was intended to estimate (e.g., a sample mean is intended to be an estimate of the population mean). In this example, the mean of all possible sample means (= 6.000 points) is equal to the mean of the original population (=6.000 points). A statistic is said to be unbiased if the center (mean) of its sampling distribution equals the parameter it was intended to estimate. This example illustrates that the sample mean is an unbiased estimate of the population mean. Third, the standard error of the statistic is less than the standard deviation of the original population. In other words, the dispersion of statistics is less than the dispersion of individuals in the population. For example, the dispersion of individuals in the population is =1.414 points, whereas the dispersion of statistics from all possible samples is SE\\(_{\\bar{\\text{x}}}=\\) 0.845 points. All statistics in this course are unbiased, which means that each statistic will equal its corresponding parameter, on average. 11.1.2 Critical Distinction Three distributions are considered in statistics: the sampling distribution is the distribution of a statistic computed from all possible samples of the same size from the same population, the population distribution is the distribution of all individuals in a population (see Module 6), and the sample distribution is the distribution of all individuals in a sample (see histograms in Module 4). For making inferences, it will be important to distinguish between population and sampling distributions. To do so, keep in mind that the sampling distribution is about statistics, whereas the population and sample distributions are about individuals. Just as importantly, remember that a standard error measures the dispersion among statistics (i.e., sampling variability), whereas a standard deviation measures dispersion among individuals (i.e., natural variability). Specifically, the population standard deviation () is the dispersion of individuals in a population distribution, whereas the standard error is the dispersion of a statistic (e.g., sample mean) in a sampling distribution. 11.1.3 Dependencies The sampling distribution of sample means from samples of n=2 from the population of quizzes was shown in Figure 11.1. The sampling distribution will look different if any other sample size is used. For example, the samples and means from each sample of n=3 are shown in Table 11.2. Table 11.2: All possible samples of n=3 and corresponding sample mean from the quiz score population. Sample Scores Mean 1 6, 6, 4 5.333 2 6, 6, 5 5.667 3 6, 6, 7 6.333 4 6, 6, 8 6.667 5 6, 4, 5 5.000 6 6, 4, 7 5.667 7 6, 4, 8 6.000 8 6, 5, 7 6.000 9 6, 5, 8 6.333 10 6, 7, 8 7.000 11 6, 4, 5 5.000 12 6, 4, 7 5.667 13 6, 4, 8 6.000 14 6, 5, 7 6.000 15 6, 5, 8 6.333 16 6, 7, 8 7.000 17 4, 5, 7 5.333 18 4, 5, 8 5.667 19 4, 7, 8 6.333 20 5, 7, 8 6.667 The mean of these means is 6.000, the standard error is 0.592, and the sampling distribution is symmetric, perhaps approximately normal (Figure 11.2). The three major characteristics of sampling distributions noted in Section 11.1.1 are still true: the sampling distribution is still more normal than the original population, the sample mean is still unbiased (i.e, the mean of the means is equal to ), and the standard error is smaller than the standard deviation of the original population. However, also take note that the standard error of the sample mean is smaller from samples of n=3 than from n=2.52 Figure 11.2: Sampling distribution of mean quiz scores from samples of n=3 from the quiz score population. The sampling distribution will also be different if the statistic changes; e.g, if the sample median rather than sample mean is computed in each sample. Before showing the results of each sample, note that the population median (i.e., the median of the individuals in the population  6, 6, 4, 5, 7, and 8) is 6.0 points. The sample median from each sample is shown in Table 11.3 and the actual sampling distribution is shown in Figure 11.3. Note that the sampling distribution of the sample medians is still more normal than the original population distribution, the mean of the sample medians (=6.000 points; thus, the sample median is also unbiased), and this sampling distribution differs from the sampling distribution of sample means (Figure 11.2). Table 11.3: All possible samples of n=3 and corresponding sample medians from the quiz score population. Sample Scores Mean 1 6, 6, 4 6 2 6, 6, 5 6 3 6, 6, 7 6 4 6, 6, 8 6 5 6, 4, 5 5 6 6, 4, 7 6 7 6, 4, 8 6 8 6, 5, 7 6 9 6, 5, 8 6 10 6, 7, 8 7 11 6, 4, 5 5 12 6, 4, 7 6 13 6, 4, 8 6 14 6, 5, 7 6 15 6, 5, 8 6 16 6, 7, 8 7 17 4, 5, 7 5 18 4, 5, 8 5 19 4, 7, 8 7 20 5, 7, 8 7 Figure 11.3: Sampling distribution of median quiz scores from n=3 samples from the quiz score population. These examples demonstrate that the naming of a sampling distribution must be specific. For example, the first sampling distribution in this module should be described as the sampling distribution of sample means from samples of n=2. This last example should be described as the sampling distribution of sample medians from samples of n=3. Doing this with each distribution reinforces the point that sampling distributions depend on the sample size and the statistic calculated. Each sampling distribution should be specifically labeled with the statistic calculated and the sample size of the samples, because the specific characteristics of a sampling distribution depend on the statistic calculated and the sample size. 11.1.4 Simulating a Sampling Distribution Exact sampling distributions can only be computed for very small samples taken from a small population. Exact sampling distributions are difficult to show for even moderate sample sizes from moderately-sized populations. For example, there are 15504 unique samples of n=5 from a population of 20 individuals. There are two ways to examine sampling distributions in situations with large sample and population sizes. First, theorems exist that describe the specifics of sampling distributions under certain conditions. One such theorem is described in Section 11.2. Second, the computer can take many (hundreds or thousands) samples and compute the statistic for each. These statistics can then be summarized to give an indication of what the actual sampling distribution would look like. This process is called simulating a sampling distribution. We will simulate some sampling distributions here so that the theorem in Section 11.2 will be easier to understand. Sampling distributions are simulated by drawing many samples from a population, computing the statistic of interest for each sample, and constructing a histogram of those statistics (Figure 11.4). The computer is helpful with this simulation; however, keep in mind that the computer is basically following the same process as used in Section 11.1.1, with the exception that not every sample is taken. Figure 11.4: Schematic representation of the process for simulating a sampling distribution. Lets return to the Square Lake fish population from Section 2.2 to illustrate simulating a sampling distribution. Recall that this is a hypothetical population with 1015 fish, a population distribution shown in Figure 2.1, and parameters shown in Table 2.1. Further recall that four samples of n=50 were removed from this population and summarized in Tables 2.2 and 2.3. Suppose, that an additional 996 samples of n=50 were extracted in exactly the same way as the first four, the sample mean was computed in each sample, and the 1000 sample means were collected to form the histogram in Figure 11.5. This histogram is a simulated sampling distribution of sample means because it represents the distribution of sample means from 1000, rather than all possible, samples. Figure 11.5: Histogram (Left) and summary statistics (Right) from 1000 sample mean total lengths computed from samples of n=50 from the Square Lake fish population. As with the actual sampling distributions discussed previously, three characteristics (shape, center, and dispersion) are examined with simulated sampling distributions. First, Figure 11.5 looks at least approximately normally distributed. Second, the mean of the 1000 means (=98.02) is approximately equal to the mean of the original 1015 fish in Square Lake (=98.06). These two values are not exactly the same because the simulated sampling distribution was constructed from only a few rather than all possible samples. Third, the standard error of the sample means (=4.18) is much less than the standard deviation of individuals in the original population (=31.49). So, within reasonable approximation, the concepts identified with actual sampling distributions also appear to hold for simulated sampling distributions. As before, computing a different statistic on each sample results in a different sampling distribution. This is illustrated by comparing the sampling distributions of a variety of statistics from the same 1000 samples of size n=50 taken above (Figure 11.6). Figure 11.6: Histograms from 1000 sample median (Left), standard deviation (Center), and range (Right) of total lengths computed from samples of n=50 from the Square Lake fish population. Note that the value in the parameter row is the value computed from the entire population. Simulating a sampling distribution by taking many samples of the same size from a population is powerful for two reasons. First, it reinforces the ideas of sampling variability  i.e., each sample results in a slightly different statistic. Second, the entire concept of inferential statistics is based on theoretical sampling distributions. Simulating sampling distributions will allow us to check this theory and better visualize the theoretical concepts. From this module forward, though, remember that sampling distributions are simulated primarily as a check of theoretical concepts. In real-life, only one sample is taken from the population and the theory is used to identify the specifics of the sampling distribution. Simulating sampling distributions is a tool for checking the theory concerning sampling distributions; however, in real-life only one sample from the population is needed. 11.2 Central Limit Theorem The sampling distribution of the sample mean was examined in the previous sections by taking all possible samples from a small population (Section 11.1.1) or taking a large number of samples from a large population (Section 11.1.4). In both instances, it was observed that the sampling distribution of the sample mean was approximately normally distributed, centered on the true mean of the population, and had a standard error that was smaller than the standard deviation of the population and decreased as n increased. In this section, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is introduced and explored as a method to identify the specific characteristics of the sampling distribution of the sample mean without going through the process of extracting all or multiple samples from the population. The CLT specifically addresses the shape, center, and dispersion of the sampling distribution of the sample means by stating that \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)~N(,\\(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\)) as long as n30, n15 and the population distribution is not strongly skewed, or the population distribution is normally distributed. Thus, the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) should be normally distributed no matter what the shape of the population distribution is as long as n30. The CLT also suggests that \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) is unbiased and that the formula for the SE\\(_{\\bar{\\text{x}}}\\) is \\(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\text{n}}}\\) regardless of the size of n. In other words, n impacts the dispersion of the sampling distribution of the sample means, but not the center or formula for computing the standard error. The validity of the CLT can be examined by simulating several (with different n) sampling distributions of \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) from the Square Lake population and from a strongly right-skewed distribution (Figure 11.7). In Figure 11.7 note that the two population distributions are shown at the very top of the figure, samplng distributions use n=5, 15, 30, and 60 are shown below that, and that expected means and SEs based on the CLT are shown on the left side of each subplot and observed means and SEs computed from the results are shown on the right side of each subplot. Please spend a few minutes to examine the following characteristics of these plots. How do the shapes of the sampling distributions change with increasing n? How well do the observed means compare to the expected means? Does this change with increasing n? How well do the observed SEs compare to the expected SEs? Does this change with increasing n? How do the SEs change with increasing n? Figure 11.7: Sampling distribution of the sample mean simulated from 5000 samples of four different sample sizes extracted from the Square Lake fish population (Left) and a strongly right-skewed population (Right). The shapes of the populations are shown in the top histogram. On each simulated sampling distribution, the vertical blue line is the mean of the 5000 means and the horizontal red line represents ±1SE from the mean. Several observations about the CLT can be made from Figure 11.7. First, the sampling distribution is approximately normal for n30 for both scenarios and is approximately normal for smaller n for the Square Lake example because that population is only slightly skewed. Second, the means of all sampling distributions in both examples are approximately equal to , regardless of n. Third, the dispersion of the sampling distributions (i.e., the SE of the means) becomes smaller with increasing n and the SE from the simulated results closely match the expected SEs. In fact, it appears that all expectations from the CLT about shape, center, and dispersion are upheld. Thus, it appears that the CLT can accurately predict what the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) is so that we dont have to take all or multiple samples from the population. 11.3 Accuracy and Precision Accuracy and precision are often used to describe characteristics of a sampling distribution. Accuracy refers to how closely a statistic estimates the intended parameter. If, on average, a statistic is approximately equal to the parameter it was intended to estimate, then the statistic is considered accurate. Unbiased statistics are also accurate statistics. Precision refers to the repeatability of a statistic. A statistic is considered to be precise if multiple samples produce similar statistics. The standard error is a measure of precision; i.e., a high SE means low precision and a low SE means high precision. The targets in Figure 11.8 provide an intuitive interpretation of accuracy and precision, whereas the sampling distributions (i.e., histograms) are what statisticians look at to identify accuracy and precision. Targets in which the blue plus (i.e., mean of the means) is close to the bullseye are considered accurate (i.e., unbiased). Similarly, sampling distributions where the observed center (i.e., blue vertical line) is very close to the actual parameter (i.e., black tick labeled with a T) are considered accurate. Targets in which the red dots are closely clustered are considered precise. Similarly, sampling distributions that exhibit little variability (low dispersion) are considered precise. Figure 11.8: The center of each target (i.e., the bullseye) and the point marked with a T (for truth) represent the parameter of interest. Each dot on the target represents a statistic computed from a single sample and, thus, the many red dots on each target represent repeated samplings from the same population. The center of the samples (analogous to the center of the sampling distribution) is denoted by a blue plus-sign on the target and a blue vertical line on the histogram. As a more concrete example, supposed that a researcher takes five samples from a population with =100. You know that the sample means (\\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)) computed from these five samples will not be exactly equal because of sampling variability. However, the means will be considered accurate if their average is equal to =100. In addition, the means will be considered precise if they are relatively close together (i.e., little sampling variability is exhibited). With this in mind, consider the four situations below where the values represent the five sample means. 98, 99, 100, 101, 102 These are accurate because they average to =100 and precise because they vary very little (SE=0.71). 80, 90, 100, 105, 125 These are accurate because they average to =100 and imprecise because they vary quite a bit (SE=7.6). 60, 61, 62, 63, 64 These are inaccurate because they do not average to =100 (=62) and precise because they vary very little (SE=0.71). 30, 50, 70, 100, 120 These are inaccurate because they do not average to =100 (=74) and imprecise because they vary quite a bit (SE=16.3). The precision of a statistics is measured by the standard error (SE); relatively small values of the SE mean the statistic is precise. See Module 1 for a review of sampling variability. These samples are found by putting the values into a vector with vals &lt;- c(6,6,4,5,7,8) and then using combn(vals,2). The means are found with mns &lt;- as.numeric(combn(vals,2,mean)). The histogram is constructed with hist(~mns,w=0.5). One should also look at the results from n=4 in one of the online Review Exercises. "],["Probability.html", "Module 12 Probability Introduction 12.1 Probability of Individuals 12.2 Probability of Statistics 12.3 A Process for Handling Probability Questions 12.4 Example Questions", " Module 12 Probability Introduction Probability is the language used to describe the proportion of times that a random event will occur. The language of probability is at the center of statistical inference (see Modules 13-16). Only a minimal understanding of probability is required to understand most basic inferential methods, including all of those in this course. Thus, only a short, example-based, introduction to probability is provided here.53 12.1 Probability of Individuals The most basic forms of probability assume that items are selected randomly. In other words, simple probability calculations require that each item, whether that item is an individual or an entire sample, has the same chance of being selected. Thus, in simple intuitive examples it will be stated that the individuals were thoroughly mixed and more realistic examples will require randomization.54 If every item has the same chance of being selected, then the probability of an event is equal to the proportion of items in the event out of the entire population. In other words, the probability is the number of items in the event divided by the total number of items in the population. For example, the probability of selecting a red ball from a thoroughly mixed box containing 15 red and 10 blue balls is equal to \\(\\frac{15}{25}\\)=0.600 (i.e., 15 individuals (balls) in the event (red) divided by the total number of individuals (all balls in the box); Figure 12.1-Left). Similarly, the probability of randomly selecting a woman from a room with 20 women and 30 men is 0.400 (\\(=\\frac{20}{50}\\); Figure 12.1-Right). In both examples, the calculation can be considered a probability because (i) individuals were randomly selected and (ii) a proportion of a total was computed. Figure 12.1: Depictions of a box with 15 red balls and 10 blue balls (Left) and a room with 30 men and 20 women (Right). The two previous examples are simple because the selection is from a small, discrete set of items. Probabilities may be computed for a continuous variable if the distribution of that variable is known for the entire population. For example, the probability that a random individual is greater than 71 inches tall can be calculated if the distribution of heights for all individuals in the population is known (or reasonably approximated). For example, as shown in Module 6, if it can be assumed that heights is N(66,3), then the proportion of individuals in the population taller than 71 inches tall is 0.048 (Figure 12.2).55 This result is a probability because (i) the individual was randomly selected and (ii) the proportion of all individuals of interest in the entire population was found. Figure 12.2: Calculation of the probability that a randomly selected individual from a \\(N(66,3)\\) population will have a height greater than 71 inches. 12.2 Probability of Statistics The probability of a statistic computed from a random sample can also be found because the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) explains the distribution of statistics from all possible samples from a population (Module 11). Probability calculations from sampling distributions will be the basis for making statistical inferences in Modules 13-16. These calculations are introduced here. If the sample size is large enough, then the CLT states that the sampling distribution of sample means is approximately normal and the methods from Module 7 may then be used to compute probabilities. Therefore questions such as what is the probability of observing a sample mean of less than 95 mm from a sample of n=50 from Square Lake? can be answered. This question is answered by first recalling that population all fish in Square Lake has =98.06 mm and =31.49 mm. Because n=50 is greater than 30, the CLT says that the distribution of the sample means from these samples is \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)~N(98.06,\\(\\frac{34.19}{\\sqrt{50}}\\)) or \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)~N(98.06,4.835). Thus, the proportion of samples of n=50 from Square Lake with an \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)&lt;95 mm is 0.263, which comes from computing the area less than 95 on a N(98.06,4.835) distribution (Figure 12.3).56 ( distrib(95,mean=98.06,sd=34.19/sqrt(50)) ) Figure 12.3: Proportion of sample means less than 95 mm on a \\(N(98.06,4.84)\\) distribution. Consider another question  what is the probability of observing a sample mean of more than 95 mm in a sample of n=40 from Square Lake? At first glance it may appear that this question can be answered from the work done for the previous question. However, the sample sizes differ between the two questions and, because the sampling distribution depends on the sample size, a different sampling distribution is used here. Because n&gt;30 the sampling distribution will be \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)~N(98.06,\\(\\frac{34.19}{\\sqrt{40}})\\) or \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)~N(98.06,5.406) (Note the different value of the SE). Thus, the answer to this question is the area to the right of 95 on a N(98.06,5.406), which is 0.714 (Figure 12.4). ( distrib(95,mean=98.06,sd=34.19/sqrt(40),lower.tail=FALSE) ) Figure 12.4: Proportion of sample means less than 95 mm on a N(98.06,5.406) distribution. Always check what sample size is being used  if the sample size changes, then the sampling distribution changes. Consider two more Square Lake example questions. First, what is the probability of observing a sample mean of more than 95 mm in a sample of n=10 from Square Lake? This question is again about a statistic, but because n&lt;15 and the population is not known to be normal it is not known that the sampling distribution is normal. Thus, this question cannot be answered. Second, What is the probability that a fish will have a length less than 85 mm? This question is about an individual, not a statistic as in the previous questions. Thus, the population distribution, NOT the sampling distribution, is appropriate here. However, this question also cannot be answered because the population distribution is not known to be normally distributed. Two points are illustrated with these last two questions. First, population distributions are used for questions about individuals and sampling distributions are used for questions about statistics. Second, if the distribution is not known to be normal, no matter which distribution is used, then the probability cannot be computed.57 One issue you may have noticed is that these calculations require knowing the mean, standard deviation, and shape (if n&lt;30) of the population. However, the population usually cannot be seen (recall Module 1) and, thus, it is uncomfortable to assume so much is known about the population. The only appropriate response to this concern is that we are building towards being able to make inferences with statements based on probabilities that take into account sampling variability. The questions in this module, while not yet realistic, will help you to better understand sampling distributions for when they are needed to make inferences in later modules. 12.3 A Process for Handling Probability Questions As seen in the previous two sections, probability questions may use either the population distribution or the sampling distribution. To properly answer these questions it is important to determine which of these two distributions to use, whether that distribution is normal or not, and the specific characteristics (i.e., mean and dispersion) of that distribution. The type of distribution to use is dictated by whether the question is about an individual or about a statistic. Questions about individuals require using the population distribution, whereas questions about statistics require using the sampling distribution. Information about the population distribution, such as whether it is normally distributed or not and what the mean and standard deviation are, will be provided in the background information to the question. In contrast, specifics about the sampling distribution must be identified from applying the rules of the Central Limit Theorem to information provided in the background. For both distributions, the probability question cannot be answered if the distribution is not normal. Both distributions are centered on , but the population distribution uses the standard DEVIATION as a measure of dispersion, whereas the sampling distribution uses the standard ERROR. Table 12.1: Which distribution to use and its characteristics based on whether the probability question is about an individual or a mean. Question about Which Distribution to use Info about Normality Center Dispersion Individual Population Background \\(\\mu\\) SD=\\(\\sigma\\) Mean Sampling CLT \\(\\mu\\) SE=\\(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\text{n}}\\) 12.4 Example Questions Suppose (as in Section 7.3) that the total miles driven per per week by a particular person is normally distributed with a mean of 160 miles and a standard deviation of 25 miles. Use this information to answer the following questions. What is the probability that the driver drives more than a mean of 175 miles in a random sample of 10 weeks? 0.029  This question is about a mean and would thus use the sampling distribution. The sampling distribution is normal because even though n&lt;15, we are told in the background that the population distribution is normal (thus, the last option in the CLT is met). This is then a Forward-Right question using a SE. The probability is computed with ( distrib(175,mean=160,sd=25/sqrt(10),lower.tail=FALSE) ) What is the probability that the driver drives more than 175 miles in a random week? 0.274  This question is about an individual (i.e., one week) and would thus use the population distribution. We are told in the background that the population distribution is normal. This is then a Forward-Right question using a SD. The probability is computed with ( distrib(175,mean=160,sd=25,lower.tail=FALSE) ) Suppose that the number of points that the Iowa Hawkeyes basketball team scores per game is right-skewed with a mean of 73 points and a standard deviation of 11 games. Use this information to answer the following questions. What is the probability that the Hawkeyes will score more than a mean of 75 points in a random sample of 10 games? Cant Answer, because the sampling distribution is not normal  This question is about a mean and would thus use the sampling distribution. The sampling distribution is NOT normal because n&lt;15 and, as told in the background, the population distribution is NOT normal (thus, no aspect of the CLT has been met). What is the probability that the Hawkeyes will score more than a mean of 75 points in a random sample of 30 games? 0.309  This question is about a mean and would thus use the sampling distribution. The sampling distribution is normal because n30 (thus, the first part of the CLT has been met). This is then a Forward-Right question using a SE. The probability is computed with ( distrib(75,mean=73,sd=22/sqrt(30),lower.tail=FALSE) ) What is the probability that the Hawkeyes will score fewer than a mean of 72 points in a random sample of 20 games? 0.419  This question is about an mean and would thus use the sampling distribution. The sampling distribution is normal because n15 and the population is not strongly skewed (thus, the second part of the CLT has been met). This is then a Forward-Left question using a SE. The probability is computed with ( distrib(72,mean=73,sd=22/sqrt(20)) ) What is the probability that the Hawkeyes will score more than 75 points in a random game? Cant Answer, because the population distribution is not normal  This question is about an individual (a game) and would thus use the popuulation distribution. The population distribution, as stated in the background, is right-skewed and is, thus, NOT normal. If a distribution is not normal then the probability cannot be computed. In that case say you cannot answer the question and the explicitly state why. See the examples in the main reading. A deeper understanding of probability is required to understand more complex inferential methods beyond those in this course. See Module 3 for methods to randomly select or allocate individuals. As computed with distrib(71,mean=66,sd=3,lower.tail=FALSE). Notice that the standard error of \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) is put into the sd= argument of distrib(). Recall that a standard error really is a standard deviation, it is just named differently (see Section 11.1.1). R has no way of knowing whether the question is about an individual or a statistic; it requires the dispersion in either case and calls both of them sd=. At least with the techniques in this course.

There are two calculations that use the results of a single sample that recognize this imperfection and allow conclusions to be made about a parameter. First, a researcher may form an a priori hypothesis about a parameter and then use the information in the sample to make a judgment about the correctness of that hypothesis. Second, a researcher may use the information in the sample to calculate a range of values that is likely to contain the parameter. The first method is called hypothesis testing and is the subject of this and the next modules. The second method consists of constructing a confidence region, which is introduced in Modules 15 and 16. Specific applications of these two techniques are described in Modules 17-21. 13.1 Hypothesis Testing &amp; The Scientific Method In its simplest form, the scientific method has four steps: Observe and describe a natural phenomenon. Formulate a hypothesis to explain the phenomenon. Use the hypothesis to predict new observations. Experimentally test the predictions. Draw a conclusion (from how the observations match the predictions). If the results of the experiment do not match the predictions, then the hypothesis is rejected and an alternative hypothesis is proposed. If the results of the experiment closely match the predictions, then belief in the hypothesis is gained, though the hypothesis will likely be subjected to further experimentation. Statistical hypothesis testing is key to using the scientific method in many fields of study and, in fact, closely follows the scientific method in concept. Statistical hypothesis testing begins by formulating two competing statistical hypotheses from a research hypothesis. One of these hypotheses (the null) is used to predict the parameter of interest. Data is then collected and statistical methods are used to determine whether the observed statistic closely matches the prediction made from the null hypothesis or not. Probability (Module 12) is used to measure the degree of matching, with sampling variability taken into account. This process and the theory underlying statistical hypothesis testing is explained in this module. 13.2 Statistical Hypotheses Hypotheses are classified into two types: (1) research hypothesis and (2) statistical hypotheses. A research hypothesis is a wordy statement about the question or phenomenon that the researcher is testing. Four example research hypotheses are: A medical researcher is concerned that a new medicine may change patients mean pulse rate (from the known mean pulse rate of 82 bpm for individuals in the study population not using the new medicine). A chemist has invented an additive to car batteries that she thinks will extend the current 36 month average life of a battery. An engineer wants to determine if a new type of insulation will reduce the average heating costs of a typical house (which are currently $145 per month). A researcher is concerned whether, on average, Alzheimers caregivers at a particular facility are clinically depressed (as suggested by a mean Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score greater than 25) Research hypotheses are converted to statistical hypotheses that are mathematical and more easily subjected to statistical methods. There are two types of statistical hypotheses: the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis, abbreviated as H0, is a specific statement of no difference between a parameter and a specific value or between two parameters. The H0 ALWAYS contains an equals sign because it always represents no difference (i.e., equal). The alternative hypothesis, abbreviated as HA, always states that there is some sort of difference between a parameter and a specific value or between two parameters. The type of difference comes from the research hypothesis and will require use of a less than (&lt;), greater than (&gt;), or not equals () sign. Null and alternative hypotheses that correspond to the four research hypotheses above are: HA:82 and H0:=82 (where  represents the mean pulse rate for individuals in the study population that take the new medicine; thus, the alternative hypothesis represents a change from the normal pulse rate). HA:&gt;36 and H0:=36 (where  represents the mean life of batteries with the new additive; thus, this alternative hypothesis represents an extension of the current battery life). HA:&lt;145 and H0:=145 (where  represents the mean monthly heating bill for houses that receive the new type of insulation; thus, this alternative hypothesis represents a decline in heating bills from the previous normal amount). HA:&gt;25 and H0:=25 (where  represents the mean BDI score; thus, this alternative hypothesis represents a mean score that indicates clinical depression). The sign used in the alternative hypothesis comes directly from the wording of the research hypothesis (Table 13.1). An alternative hypothesis that contains the  sign is called a two-tailed alternative, as the parameter can be not equal in two ways; i.e., less than or greater than. Alternative hypotheses with the &lt; or the &gt; signs are called one-tailed alternatives. Table 13.1: Common words that indicate which sign to use in the alternative hypothesis. &lt; &gt; \\(\\neq\\) is less than is greater than is not equal to is fewer than is more than is different from is lower than is larger than has changed from is shorter than is longer than is not the same as is smaller than is increased from is below is above is reduced from is better than is at most is at least is not more than is not less than The null hypothesis is easily constructed from the alternative hypothesis by replacing the sign in the alternative hypothesis with an equals sign. 13.2.1 Hypothesis Testing Concept Statistical hypothesis testing begins by using the null hypothesis to predict what value one should expect for the mean in a sample. So, for the Square Lake example (from Module 1), if H0:=105 and HA:&lt;105, then one would expect, if the null hypothesis is true, that the observed sample mean would be 105. If sampling variability did not exist, then one would conclude that the null hypothesis was incorrect if the observed sample mean was NOT equal to 105. In other words, one would conclude that the population mean was not equal to 105. Of course, sampling variability does exist and it complicates matters. The simple interpretation of not supporting H0 because the observed sample mean did not equal the hypothesized population mean canNOT be made because, with sampling variability, one would not expect a statistic to exactly equal the parameter in the population from which the sample was extracted. For example, even if the null hypothesis was correct, one would not expect, with sampling variability, the observed sample mean to exactly equal 105; rather, one would expect the observed sample mean to be reasonably close to 105. Thus, hypothesis testing is a process to determine if the difference between the observed statistic and the expected statistic based on the null hypothesis is large relative to sampling variability. For example, the standard error of \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) for samples of n=50 in the Square Lake example is \\(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}=\\)\\(\\frac{31.49}{\\sqrt{50}}\\)=4.45. With this amount of sampling variability, an observed sample mean of 103 would be considered reasonably close to 105 and one would have more belief in H0:=105 (Figure 13.1). However, an observed sample mean of 90 is further away from 105 than one would expect based on sampling variability alone and belief in H0:=105 would lessen (Figure 13.1). Figure 13.1: Sampling distribution of samples means of n=50 from the Square Lake population ASSUMING that =105. While the above procedure is intuitively appealing, the conclusions are not as clear when the examples chosen (i.e., samples means of 103 and 90) are not as extremely close or distant from the null hypothesized value. For example, what would one conclude if the observed sample mean was 97?. A first step in creating a more objective decision criteria is to compute the p-value. A p-value is the probability of the observed statistic or a value of the statistic more extreme assuming that the null hypothesis is true. The p-value is described in more detail below given its centrality to making conclusions about statistical hypotheses. The meaning of the phrase or more extreme in the p-value definition is derived from the sign in HA (Figure 13.2). If HA is the less than situation, then or more extreme means shade to the left for the probability calculation. The greater than situation is defined similarly but would result in shading to the right. In the not equals situation, or more extreme means further into the tail AND the exact same size of tail on the other side of the distribution. It is clear from Figure 13.2 why less than and greater than are called one-tailed alternatives and not equals is called a two-tailed alternative. Figure 13.2: Depiction of or more extreme (red areas) in p-values for the three possible alternative hypotheses. The assuming that the null hypothesis is true phrase is used to define a  for the sampling distribution on which the p-value will be calculated. This sampling distribution is called the null distribution because it depends on the value of  from the null hypothesis. One must remember that the null distribution represents the distribution of all possible sample means assuming that the null hypothesis is true; it does NOT represent the actual sample means.58 The null distribution in the Square Lake example is thus \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)~N(105,4.45) because n=5030 (so the Central Limit Theorem holds), H0:=105, and SE=\\(\\frac{31.49}{\\sqrt{50}}\\)=4.45. The p-value is computed with a forward normal distribution calculation on the null sampling distribution. For example, suppose that a sample mean of 100 was observed with n=50 from Square Lake (as it was in Table 2.2). The p-value in this case would be the probability of observing \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)=100 or a smaller value assuming that =105. This probability is computed by finding the area to the left of 100 on a N(105,4.45) null distribution and is the exact same type of calculation as that made in Section 12.2. Thus, this p-value of p=0.1308 is computed as below and shown in Figure 13.3. ( distrib(100,mean=105,sd=31.49/sqrt(50)) ) Figure 13.3: Depiction of the p-value for the Square Lake example where \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)=100 and HA:&lt;105. Interpreting the p-value requires critically thinking about the p-value definition and how it is calculated. Small p-values appear when the observed statistic is far from the null hypothesized value. In this case there is a small probability of seeing the observed statistic ASSUMING that H0 is true. Thus, the assumption is likely wrong and H0 is likely incorrect. In contrast, large p-values appear when the observed statistic is close to the null hypothesized value suggesting that the assumption about H0 may be correct. The p-value serves as a numerical measure on which to base a conclusion about H0. To do this objectively requires an objective definition of what it means to be a small or large p-value. Statisticians use a cut-off value, called the rejection criterion and symbolized with , such that p-values less than  are considered small and would result in rejecting H0 as a viable hypothesis. The value of  is typically small, usually set at 0.05, although =0.01 and =0.10 are also commonly used. The choice of  is made by the person conducting the hypothesis test and is based on how much evidence a researcher demands before rejecting H0. Smaller values of  require a larger difference between the observed statistic and the null hypothesized value and, thus, require more evidence of a difference for the H0 to be rejected. For example, if rejection of the null hypothesis will be heavily scrutinized by regulatory agencies, then the researcher may want to be very sure before claiming a difference and should then set  at a smaller value, say =0.01. The actual choice for  MUST be made before collecting any data and canNOT be changed once the data has been collected. In other words, once the data are in hand, a researcher cannot lower or raise  to achieve a desired outcome regarding H0. The value of the rejection criterion () is set by the researcher BEFORE data is collected. The null hypothesis in the Square Lake example is not rejected because the p-value (i.e., 0.1308) is larger than any of the common values of . Thus, the conclusion in this example is that it is possible that the mean of the entire population is equal to 105 and it is not likely that the population mean is less than 105. In other words, observing a sample mean of 100 is likely to happen based on random sampling variability alone and it is unlikely that the null hypothesized value is incorrect. 13.3 Example p-value Calculations The following are examples for calculating a p-value given typical information. I suggest that you following these steps when calculating a p-value Identify H0 and HA Define the p-value specific to the situation. In the generic p-value definition (probability of the observed statistic or a value more extreme assuming the H0 is true) replaceobserved statistic\" with the value of \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\), more extreme with less, greater, or different depending on HA, and the H0 is true with the specific value of  in H0. Draw the null distribution. This is the sampling distribution assuming that H0 is true. Thus, it will be centered on the  in H0 and will use a standard error of \\(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\text{n}}}\\). Compute the p-value. This will be a FORWARD calculation on a normal distribution centered on  from H0 with an area shaded more extreme (depending on HA) of \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\). If HA is a not equals then more extreme means into the nearest tail and then multiplied by 2. Make a decision about H0. If the question has a context then the parameter should be stated within the context of the question. If the p-value&lt; then reject H0 (in favor of HA. If the p-value&gt; then do not reject (DNR) H0 (in favor of HA). Example - Taking a Quiz (Less Than HA) Suppose that I hypothesized that the mean time to take a quiz is less than 100 minutes. Further suppose that, in a sample of 30 students, the mean time to take the quiz was 95.2 minutes and that =20 and =0.10. H0: =100 versus HA: &lt;100, where  is the mean time to take a quiz. The p-value is the probability that \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)=95.2 or less assuming that =100. The null distribution will have a mean of 100 and a SE of \\(\\frac{20}{\\sqrt{30}}\\)=3.651. See drawing below. The p-value is 0.0943 as computed below. Reject H0 because p-value (0.0943) &lt;  (0.10). Thus, it appears that the MEAN time for ALL students to take the quiz is less than 100 minutes. distrib(95.2,mean=100,sd=20/sqrt(30)) Example - Walking to Class (Greater Than HA) Suppose that I hypothesized that the mean time to walk between the Science Center and the Ponzio Center is more than 7 minutes. Further suppose that, in a sample of 50 students, the mean time to make this walk was 8.3 minutes and that =1.3 and =0.05. H0: =7 versus HA: &gt;7, where  is the mean time to walk between the Science Center and the Ponzio Center. The p-value is the probability that \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)=8.3 or greater assuming that =7. The null distribution will have a mean of 7 and a SE of \\(\\frac{1.3}{\\sqrt{50}}\\)=0.184. See drawing below. The p-value is 0.0000000000007687 as computed below. Note that the p-value does not need all of these decimals and, thus, I will usually show this as &lt;0.00005. Reject H0 because p-value &lt;  (0.05). Thus, it appears that the MEAN time for ALL students to walk between the Science Center and the Ponzio Center is greater than 7 minutes. distrib(8.3,mean=7,sd=1.3/sqrt(50),lower.tail=FALSE) Exapmle Preparation Guide Time (Not Equals HA) Suppose that I hypothesized that the mean time students spend preparing the preparation guide is different than 30 minutes and that, in a sample of 40 students, the mean preparation time was 33.8 minutes. Further, suppose that =9.7 and =0.01. H0: =30 versus HA: 30, where  is the mean time preparing for the prep check. The p-value is the probability that \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)=33.8 or no assuming that =30. The null distribution will have a mean of 30 and a SE of \\(\\frac{9.7}{\\sqrt{40}}\\)=1.534. See drawing below. The half p-value is 0.0066 as computed below. Thus, the p-value is 0.0132 Do not reject H0 because p-value (0.0132) &gt;  (0.01). Thus, it appears that the MEAN time that ALL students spend preparing for the prep check is not different than 30 minutes. distrib(33.8,mean=30,sd=9.7/sqrt(40),lower.tail=FALSE) When HA is a not equals then the area shaded on the null distribution is into the nearest tail. In this case, because \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) (=33.8) was greater than the mean of the distribution (=30), I shaded to the right (into the nearer upper tail). If the \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) had been lower, I would have shaded to the left. In these situations (i.e., when HA is a not equals) then the area returned by distrib() must be multiplied by two to get the p-value (to account for both tails of the same size). 13.4 Hypothesis Testing Concept Summary In summary, hypotheses are statistically examined with the following procedure. Construct null and alternative hypotheses from the research hypothesis. Construct an expected value of the statistic based on the null hypothesis (i.e., assume that the null hypothesis is true). Calculate an observed statistic from the individuals in a sample. Compare the difference between the observed statistic and the expected statistic based on the null hypothesis in relation to sampling variability (i.e., calculate a test statistic and p-value). Use the p-value to determine if this difference is large or not. If this difference is large (i.e., p-value&lt;), then reject the null hypothesis. If this difference is not large (i.e., p-value&gt;), then Do Not Reject the null hypothesis. Statisticians say do not reject H0 rather than accept H0 as true when the p-value &gt; for two reasons. First, there are several other possible values, besides the specific value in the null hypothesis, that would lead to do not reject conclusions. For example, if a null hypothesized value of 105 was not rejected, then values of 104.99, 104.98, etc. would also likely not be rejected.59 So, we dont say that we accept a particular hypothesized value when we know many other values would also be accepted. Second, the null hypothesis is almost always not true. Consider the null hypothesis of the Square Lake example (i.e., that the mean length is 105 mm). The mean length of fish in Square Lake is undoubtedly not exactly equal to 105. It may be 104.9, 105.01, or some other more disparate value. The point is that the specific value of the hypothesis is likely never true, especially for a continuous variable. The problem is that it takes large amounts of data to be able to distinguish means that are very close to the true population mean (i.e., it is difficult to distinguish between 104.9 and 105 when sampling variability is present). Very often we will not take a sample size large enough to distinguish these subtle differences. Thus, we will say that we do not reject H0 because there simply was not enough data to reject it. Of course, unless the null hypothesis happens to be perfectly true. In fact, for example, the values in a 95% confidence interval  see Module 15  represent all possible hypothesized values that would not be rejected with a two-tailed HA using =0.05. "],["HypTesting2.html", "Module 14 Hypothesis Testing - Errors 14.1 Error Types 14.2 Error Rates 14.3 Test Statistics and Effect Sizes", " Module 14 Hypothesis Testing - Errors In Module 13 we examined the concept of hypothesis testing and showed how a p-value is calculated and used to reject or not reject H0. The basic concept there is that if the p-value is small (&lt;) then it unlikely that the observed statistic would come from a population with the parameter in the H0. It is important to note the word unlikely in this statement. It is possible that the observed statistic would come from this population, just unlikely. In the case where this unlikely event actually happened, we would make an error in our conclusion about H0. These errors are discussed in this module. 14.1 Error Types The goal of hypothesis testing is to make a decision about H0. Unfortunately, because of sampling variability, there is always a risk of making an incorrect decision. Two types of incorrect decisions can be made (Table 14.1). A Type I error occurs when a true H0 is falsely rejected. In other words, even if H0 is true, there is a chance that a rare sample will occur and H0 will be deemed incorrect. A Type II error occurs when a false H0 is not rejected. Table 14.1: Types of decisions that can be made from a hypothesis test. Truth about Popn Decision from Test Error Type H0 is true Reject H0 Type I (\\(\\alpha\\)) H0 is true DNR H0  HA is true Reject H0  HA is true DNR H0 Type II (\\(\\beta\\)) It is important to be able to articulate what Type I and a Type II errors are within the context of a specific situation. For example, suppose that if the mean abundance of a rare plant in a particular area drops below 0.5 plants per m2 then there is a real concern that that plant will become extinct. A researcher may conduct a study to determine if the mean abundance of this plant has dropped below the 0.5 m2 threshold or not. The null and alternative hypotheses would be H0: =0.5, where  is the mean abundance of the plant per m2 HA: &lt;0.5 Before articulating what the errors would be in this example, it is useful to write in words what the hypotheses are within the context of the situation. H0: abundance at or above the threshold; population not at risk of extinction HA: abundance below the threshold; population at risk of extinction From the definition of a Type I error (i.e., incorrectly rejecting a true H0), a Type I error occurs if we conclude that HA is true when H0 is really true. In this scenario then, a Type I error would be concluding that the abundance of the plant is low (think HA is true) when the abundance is really not low (H0 is really true) or concluding that the population is at risk of extinction when the population is really not at risk of extinction. From the definition of a Type II error (i.e., incorrectly not rejecting a false H0), a Type II error is concluding that H0 is true when HA is really true. In this scenario then, a Type II error is concluding that the abundance of the plant is not low (think H0 is true) when the abundance is really low (HA is really true) or concluding that the population is not at risk of extinction when the population is really at risk of extinction. 14.2 Error Rates The decision in the Square Lake example of Module 13 was a Type II error because H0:=105 was not rejected even though we know that =98.06 (Table 2.1). Unfortunately, in real life, it will never be known exactly when a Type I or a Type II error has been made because the true  is not known. However, the rates at which these errors are made can be considered. The probability of making a Type I error is set when  is chosen. Thus, the researcher can largely choose the rate at which they will make a Type I error. The probability of a Type II error is denoted by , which is never known because calculating  requires knowing the true but unknown . Decisions can be made, however, that affect the magnitude of  (Figure 14.1). There are two items that affect  that a researcher can control  the size of  and n. The  decreases as  increases (Figure 14.1); i.e., the researcher is reducing Type II errors by allowing for more Type errors. In other words, the researcher is simply trading errors, which may be appropriate if a Type II error is more egregious than a Type I error. The  also decreases with increasing n (Figure 14.1); i.e., fewer errors are made as more information is gathered. Of these two choices, reducing  by increasing n is generally more beneficial because it does not result in an increase in Type I errors as would occur with increasing . Figure 14.1: The relationship between one-tailed (lower)  and , n, actual mean (A), and . In all situations where the variable does not vary, 0=105, A=98.06, =31.49, n=50, and =0.05. The value of  is als related to two items that a researcher cannot control. The  increases as the difference between the hypothesized mean (0) and the actual mean (A) decreases (Figure 14.1). This means that more Type II errors will be made when the hypothesized and actual mean are close together. In other words, more Type II errors are made when it is harder to distinguish the hypothesized mean from the actual mean. In addition,  increases with increasing amounts of natural variability (i.e., ; Figure 14.1). In other words, more Type II errors are made when there is more variability among individuals. A researcher cannot control the difference between 0 and A or the value of . However, it is important to know that if a situation with a large amount of variability is encountered or the difference to be detected is small, the researcher will need to increase n to reduce . For example, if n could be doubled in the Square Lake example to 100, then  (for H0:=105) would decrease to approximately 0.18 (Figure 14.1). Statistical Power A concept that is very closely related to decision-making errors is the idea of statistical power, or just power for short. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false H0. In other words, it is the probability of detecting a difference from the hypothesized value if a difference really exists. Power is used to demonstrate how sensitive a hypothesis test is for identifying a difference. High power related to a H0 that is not rejected implies that the H0 really should not have been rejected. Conversely, low power related to a H0 that was not rejected implies that the test was very unlikely to detect a difference, so not rejecting H0 is not surprising nor particularly conclusive. Power is equal to 1-. 14.3 Test Statistics and Effect Sizes Instead of reporting the observed statistic and the resulting p-value, it may be of interest to know how far the observed statistic was from the hypothesized value of the parameter. This is easily calculated with \\[ \\text{Observed Statistic}-\\text{Hypothesized Parameter} \\] where Hypothesized Parameter represents the specific value in H0. However, the meaning of this difference is difficult to interpret without an understanding of the standard error of the statistic. For example, a difference of 10 between the observed statistic and the hypothesized parameter seems very different if the standard error is 3 but does not seem different if the standard error is 15 (Figure 14.2). Figure 14.2: Sampling distribution of samples means with SE=3 (Left) and SE=15 (Right). A single observed sample mean of 90 (a difference of 10 from the hypothesized mean of 100) is shown by the red dot and arrow. The difference between the observed statistic and the hypothesized parameter is standardized to a common scale by dividing by the standard error of the statistic. The result is called a test statistic and is generalized with \\[ \\text{Test Statistic} = \\frac{\\text{Observed Statistic}-\\text{Hypothesized Parameter}}{\\text{SE}_{\\text{Statistic}}} \\] Thus, the test statistic measures how many standard errors the observed statistic is away from the hypothesized parameter.60 A relatively large value of the test statistic is indicative of a difference that is likely not due to randomness (i.e., sampling variability) and suggests that the null hypothesis should be rejected. The test statistic in the Square Lake Example is \\(\\frac{100-105}{\\frac{31.49}{\\sqrt{50}}}\\)=-1.12. Thus, the observed mean total length of 100 mm is 1.12 standard errors below the null hypothesized mean of 105 mm. From our experience, a little over one SE from the mean is not extreme and, thus, it is not surprising that the null hypothesis was not rejected. There are other forms for calculating test statistics, but all test statistics retain the general idea of scaling the difference between what was observed and what was expected from the null hypothesis in terms of sampling variability. Even though there is a one-to-one relationship between a test statistic and a p-value, a test statistic is often reported with a hypothesis test to give another feel for the magnitude of the difference between what was observed and what was predicted. This is very closely related to the concept of Z-scores and standardization introduced in Section 7.4. "],["ConfRegions1.html", "Module 15 Confidence Regions - Introduction 15.1 Confidence Concept 15.2 Constructing Confidence Regions 15.3 Example Confidence Region Calculations", " Module 15 Confidence Regions - Introduction The final result from a hypothesis test (Module 13) can feel uneventful  i.e., either conclude that the parameter may be equal to or different from the hypothesized value.61 If the parameter is thought to be different from the hypothesized value we might then say that our best guess at the parameter is the observed statistic. However, as shown in Module 11, a statistic is an imperfect estimate of the unknown parameter because of sampling variability. This imperfectness can be recognized by computing a range of values that is likely to contain the parameter. For example, we may make a statement such as this  I am 95% confident that the mean length of ALL fish in the lake is between 95.9 and 101.1 mm. The range in this sentence acknowledges sampling variability and is called a confidence region. In this module, the concept, calculation, and interpretation of confidence regions is explored. 15.1 Confidence Concept In this section, we focus on a 95% confidence interval (CI). General methods for constructing other types of confidence regions with other levels of confidence are in Section 15.2. Our goal here is to understand what it means to be 95% confident that the parameter is within the CI range. A 95% confidence interval for the population mean is computed with \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)±2×SE\\(_{\\bar{\\text{x}}}\\). Again, the specifics of this will be discussed in Section 15.2, but note here that 2 SEs are used for a 95% CI because of the 68-95-99.7% Rule (see Section 6.3). For example, using the results of the first sample from Square Lake (Table 2.2) a 95% CI for the mean total length for the Square Lake population is 100.04±2\\(\\frac{31.49}{\\sqrt{50}}\\), 100.04±8.91, or (91.13,108.95). With this, we would conclude that the mean total length for ALL fish in Square Lake is between 91.13 and 108.95 mm. For the Square Lake example (introduced in Module 1), it was known that =98.06 (Table 2.1). Thus, this particular CI actually does contain  as 98.06 is between 91.13 and 108.95. In other words, this particular CI accomplished what it was intended to do; i.e., provide a range that contained .62 Despite the success observed in this first sample, not all confidence intervals will contain . For example, four of 100 95% confidence intervals shown in Figure 15.1 did not contain . Thus, the researcher would have concluded that  was in an incorrect interval four times in these 100 samples. The concept of confidence in confidence regions is related to determining how often the intervals correctly contain the parameter. Figure 15.1: Sampling distribution of the sample mean (top) and 100 95% confidence intervals (horizontal lines) from samples of n=50 from the Square Lake population. Confidence intervals that do NOT contain =98.06 are shown in red and with an open circle. The green shaded area represents 95% of the sample means. See text for more explanation. From the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) for samples of n=50 is N(98.06,\\(\\frac{31.49}{\\sqrt{50}}\\)) or N(98.06,4.45) for this known population. According to the 68-95-99.7% Rule, it is known that 95% of the sample means in this sampling distribution will be between ±2×SE or, in this specific case, between 98.06±2×4.45. The sampling distribution and this range of expected sample means is shown at the top of Figure 15.1. Note that any sample that produced a mean (dot on the CI line) inside the expected range of sample means (light green area) also produced a 95% CI that contained  (i.e., black CI line with a solid circle). Because 95% of the sample means will be within the expected range of sample means, 95% of the 95% CIs will contain . So, 95% confident means that 95% of all 95% CIs will contain the parameter and 5% will not. In other words, the mistake identified above will be made with only 5% of all 95% CIs. The specifics for constructing confidence regions with different levels of confidence is described below. However, at this point, it should be noted that the number of CIs expected to contain the parameter of interest is set by the level of confidence used to construct the CI. For example, 80% of 80% CIs and 90% of 90% CIs will contain the parameter of interest. In either case, a particular CI either does or does not contain the interval and, in real-life, we will never know whether it does or does not (i.e., we wont know the value of the parameter). However, we do know that the technique (i.e., the construction of the CI) will work (i.e., contain the parameter) a set percentage of the time. To reiterate this point, examine the 100 90% CIs (Figure 15.2-Left) and 100 80% CIs (Figure 15.2-Right) for the Square Lake fish length data. Figure 15.2: Sampling distribution of the sample mean (tops) and 100 random 90% (Left) and 80% (Right) confidence intervals (horizontal lines) from samples of n=50 from the Square Lake population. Confidence intervals that do NOT contain  are shown in red. The concept of confidence regions can be difficult to grasp at first. Thus, one should consider the following subtleties about confidence regions. Each sample results in a different 95% CI (see CI lines in Figures 15.1 and 15.2) just like it results in a different \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) (see dots on CI lines in Figures 15.1 and 15.2). Any CI either contains the parameter (e.g., ) or it does not. However, on average, 95% of 95% CIs will contain the parameter and 5% will not. That is, 95% of all possible 95% CIs wil contain the parameter. A 95% CI is a technique that works correctly 95% of the time. In other words, 95% of all 95% CI capture the unknown parameter. Because of these subtleties, confidence regions are often misinterpreted. Common misinterpretations are listed below with an explanation for the misinterpretation in parentheses. These misinterpretations should be studied, compared to the interpretations discussed above, and avoided. There is a 95% probability that the population mean is contained in the confidence interval. This is incorrect because the population mean is constant (not random), it either is or is not in a particular CI, and it will never change whether it is or is not in that CI. The CI, not the parameter, is random. There is a 95% probability that the sample mean is contained in the confidence interval. This is incorrect for the simple fact that CI are not used to estimate sample means (or, generally, statistics); they are used to estimate population means (or parameters). Furthermore, the sample mean has to be exactly in the middle of the CI (see next section). 95% of all 95% confidence intervals are contained in the confidence interval. First, this is physically impossible because each CI is the same width (if n and the level of confidence stay constant). Second, it is not important how many CI are contained in a CI; interest is in whether the parameter is in the interval or not. Confidence intervals are constructed for parameters, not statistics. Care and specificity must be used when interpreting and describing confidence intervals. 15.2 Constructing Confidence Regions Not all confidence regions are designed to contain the parameter 95% of the time, are intervals, or are computed to contain . Confidence regions can be constructed for any level of confidence, as intervals or bounds, and for nearly all parameters. The level of confidence (C) used will be determined by the  chosen for the hypothesis test; specifically, C=100(1-)%. For example, if  is set at 0.05, then the level of confidence will be 100(1-0.05)% (Table 15.1). Thus, if  is decreased such that fewer Type I errors are made, then the confidence level will increase and more of the confidence regions will contain the parameter of interest (i.e., fewer errors). In this manner the proportion of Type I errors in hypothesis testing is linked to the proportion of errors made with confidence regions. Table 15.1: Several common probabilities of a Type I error () and the corresponding confidence levels (C). \\(\\alpha\\) C 0.01 99% 0.05 95% 0.10 90% The type of confidence region depends on the type of alternative hypothesis (Table 15.2). If the alternative hypothesis is two-tailed (i.e., ), then the confidence region will be an interval (i.e., a range will be computed, as in Section 15.1). However, if the alternative hypothesis is one-tailed, then a confidence bound is used. For example, if the alternative hypothesis is a less than, then interest lies in determining what is the largest possible value for the parameter (rather than a range of possible values). In other words, if the alternative hypothesis is a less than, then an upper confidence bound for the parameter is constructed. In contrast, if the alternative hypothesis is a greater than, then a lower confidence bound is constructed to estimate the smallest possible value for the parameter. Table 15.2: Confidence regions and their interpretation in relation to alternative hypotheses (\\(H_{A}\\)) types. \\(H_{A}\\) Confidence Region Interpretation \\(\\neq\\) Interval (CI) Parameter between CI values \\(\\lt\\) Upper Bound (UCB) Parameter less than UCB value \\(\\gt\\) Lower Bound (LCB) Parameter greater than UCB value Fortunately, most confidence regions follow the same basic form of \\[ ``\\text{Statistic&quot;} + ``\\text{scaling factor&quot;} \\times \\text{SE}_{\\text{statistic}} \\] where Statistic represents the statistic used to estimate the parameter, SEstatistic is the standard error of that statistic, and scaling factor\"×SEstatistic is called the margin-of-error. The scaling factor is computed from a known distribution. When  is known, the scaling factor is computed from a N(0,1) and is called Z*. Thus, in the case when a confidence interval is being constructed for  and  is known, the specific formula for the confidence region is \\[ \\bar{\\text{x}} + Z^{*}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\] The scaling factor serves to control the width and type of confidence region. The magnitude of the scaling factor controls the relative width of the region such that the parameter is contained in the region at a rate according to the level of confidence. For example, the scaling factor for a 99% confidence region will be set such that 99% of the confidence regions will contain the parameter. The sign of the scaling factor controls whether an interval, upper bound, or lower bound is computed. For example, if the alternative hypothesis is two-tailed, then Z* is the two values such that an area equal to the level of confidence is contained between them (Figure 15.3-Left). The two values that delineate these boundaries will be the same value but with different signs because the N(0,1) is symmetric about zero. Thus, a confidence interval is computed with a scaling factor of ±Z*. Figure 15.3: Areas (yellow) that define Z* for confidence regions of a parameter in a hypothesis test. In contrast, if the alternative hypothesis is a less than, then an upper confidence bound is desired and Z* has an area equal to the level of confidence LESS THAN it (Figure 15.3-Middle). As the level of confidence will always be greater than 50%, this definition will produce a positive Z* so that the scaling factor will be +Z*. Similarly, if the alternative hypothesis is a greater than, then a lower confidence bound is desired and Z* has an area equal to the level of confidence GREATER THAN it (Figure 15.3-Right). This definition produces a negative Z* so that the scaling factor will be -Z*. When finding Z* for a confidence bound, the level of confidence always represents an area shaded in the same direction as the sign in HA. 15.3 Example Confidence Region Calculations Constructing a proper confidence region should follow the five steps below. These steps are illustrated in three examples further below. Identify the level of confidence (i.e., C=100(1-)%; Table 15.1). Identify the type of confidence regions  interval, lower bound, or upper bound (Table 15.2). Determine the scaling factor. Compute the actual confidence region. Interpret the confidence region. Example - Square Lake (Less Than HA) Consider the Square Lake example where HA:&lt;105, =0.05, and \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)=100.04 from n=50 (Table 2.2). C=95% (=100(1-0.05)). Upper confidence bound because HA is a less than. Z*=+1.645 as show below. Note that mean=0 and sd=1 are the default settings for distrib() and can, thus, be omitted when finding a Z*. 100.04+1.645\\(\\frac{31.49}{\\sqrt{50}}\\), 100.04+7.33, or 107.37. One is 95% confident that the mean total length of ALL fish in Square Lake is less than 107.4 mm. distrib(0.95,type=&quot;q&quot;) Example - Lake Superior Ice Cover (Not Equals HA) Suppose that the Lake Superior ice cover data from Table 5.2 (note that \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)=107.8 and n=42) was tested with HA: 100, =22, and =0.01. C=99% (=100(1-0.01)). Confidence interval because HA is a not equals. Z*=±2.576 as computed below. Here we are trying to find the two values of Z with the most common 99% of values between them. As is typical for a reverse-between calculation you want to find half the area outside of the most common value; i.e., 0.005. In this case I found the -Z* value; the other value is simply the positive version of this because the distribution is symmetric around 0. 107.8±2.576\\(\\frac{22}{\\sqrt{42}}\\), 107.8±8.74, or (99.06,116.54). One is 95% confident that the mean number of days of ice cover on Lake Superior during ALL years is between 99.1 and 116.5 days. distrib(0.005,type=&quot;q&quot;) Example - Battery Life (Greater Than HA) Ssuppose that the second example hypothesis test in Module 13 about battery life (i.e., HA:&gt;36 vs H0:=36) is being tested with =0.10. Further suppose that =7 and that \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)=45 from n=40. C=90% (=100(1-0.10)). Lower confidence bound because HA is a greater than. Z*=-1.282 as computed below. 45-1.282\\(\\frac{7}{\\sqrt{40}}\\), 45-1.42, or 43.58. Note that this becomes a subtraction because we are adding a margin-of-error that is computed with a negative Z*. Adding a negative presents as a subtraction. One is 90% confident that the mean life for ALL batteries with the additive is more than 43.58 months. distrib(0.90,type=&quot;q&quot;,lower.tail=FALSE) Depending on the HA it may be known if the parameter is more or less than the hypothesized value. In reality you would usually not be able to determine if the CI contained  or not because  is typically not known. We use the Square Lake example here purely to demonstrate the concept of what 95% confidence means. "],["ConfRegions2.html", "Module 16 Confidence Regions - Extension 16.1 Confidence Intervals and Precision 16.2 Sample Size Calculations 16.3 Inference Type Relationship", " Module 16 Confidence Regions - Extension In Module 15 the concept, calculation, and interpreation of confidence regions were introduced. In this module, some miscellaneous relationships and extensions of that material are introduced. 16.1 Confidence Intervals and Precision The width of a confidence interval explains how precisely the parameter is estimated.63 More specifically, narrow intervals represent precise estimates of the parameter, whereas wide intervales represent imprecise estimates of the parameter. The width of a confidence interval is directly related to the margin-of-error64 which depends on (1) the standard error and (2) the scaling factor. As either of these two items gets smaller (while holding the other constant), the width of the confidence interval gets smaller. A small standard error means that sampling variability is low and precision is high. Smaller standard errors are obtained only by increasing the sample size. A smaller standard deviation would also result in a smaller SE, but the standard deviation cannot be made smaller (i.e., it is an inherent characteristic of the population). A smaller scaling factor is obtained by reducing the level of confidence. For example, a 90% confidence interval uses a Z* of ±1.645, whereas a 95% confidence interval uses a Z* of ±1.960. Thus, decreasing the confidence level narrows the CI. However, reducing the level of confidence will also increase the number of confidence intervals that do not contain the parameter. Thus, reducing the level of confidence may not be the best choice for narrowing the confidence interval. 16.2 Sample Size Calculations As noted in the previous module, the portion of the confidence interval to the right of the ± symbol is called the margin-of-error (ME). Thus, \\[ \\text{ME} = \\text{Z}^{*}\\times\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\text{n}}} \\] This margin-of-error formula can be solved for n. \\[\\begin{split} \\text{ME} &amp;= \\text{Z}^{*}\\times\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\text{n}}} \\\\ \\sqrt{\\text{n}} &amp;= \\frac{\\text{Z}^{*}\\times\\sigma}{\\text{ME}} \\\\ \\text{n} &amp;= \\left(\\frac{\\text{Z}^{*}\\times\\sigma}{\\text{ME}}\\right)^{2} \\\\ \\end{split} \\] This formula can be used to find the n required to estimate  within ± ME units with C% confidence assuming that  is known. For example, suppose that one wants to determine n required to estimate the mean length of fish in Square Lake to within 5 mm with 90% confidence knowing that the population standard deviation is 34.91. From this, ME=5, =34.91, and Z*=1.645 (found previously for 90% confidence).65 Thus, n = \\(\\left(\\frac{1.645\\times34.91}{5}\\right)^{2}\\) = 131.91. Therefore, a sample of at least 132 fish from Square Lake should be taken to meet these constraints. Sample size calculations are always rounded up to the next integer because rounding down would produce a sample size that does not meet the desired criteria. The margin-of-error and confidence level in these calculations need to come from the researchers beliefs about how much error they can live with (i.e., chance that a confidence interval does not contain the parameter) and how precise their estimate of the mean needs to be (i.e., the ME they desire). Values for  are rarely known in practice (because it is a parameter) and estimates from preliminary studies, previous similar studies, similar populations, or best guesses are often used instead. In practice, a researcher will often prepare a graph with varying values of  to make an informed decision of what sample size to choose. 16.3 Inference Type Relationship An alternative conceptualization of confidence intervals can show how confidence regions and hypothesis tests are related. This conceptualization rests on considering the sample means that would be reasonable to see from populations with various values of . A graphic is constructed below using the Square Lake population as an example and assuming that  is known (=31.49), n=50, and 95% CIs are used. First, compute the most common 95% of sample means assuming that =70; i.e., 70±1.960\\(\\frac{31.49}{\\sqrt{50}}\\) or (61.27,78.73). This range is plotted as a vertical rectangle centered on =70 (left-most rectangle) in Figure 16.1-Left. Next, compute and plot the same range for a slightly larger  (e.g., with =71, plot (62.27,78.73)). Then repeat these steps for sequentially larger values of  until a plot similar to Figure 16.1-Left is constructed. Figure 16.1: Range (95%) of sample means that would be produced by particular population means in the Square Lake fish length example. Consider very carefully what Figure 16.1-Left represents. The vertical rectangles represent the ranges of the most common 95% of sample means (values read from the y-axis) that will be produced for a particular population mean (value read from the x-axis). In essence, each vertical line represents the sample means that are likely to be observed from a population with a given population mean (x-axis). Now suppose that \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)=100.04 (Table 2.2). Draw a horizontal line across Figure 16.1 at this value and then draw vertical lines down from where the horizontal line first enters and last leaves the band of possible sample means (Figure 16.2). The x-axis values that these vertical lines intercept are an approximate 95% CI for . Figure 16.2: Range (95%) of sample means that would be produced by particular population means in the Square Lake fish length example with the ranges intercepted by \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)=100.04 mm. The actual confidence interval computed in Module 16 was (91.27,108.73), which compares favorably to the (92,108) from Figure 16.2. The approximation here will only as close as the intervals used to construct the rectangles (i.e., 1.0 mm were used here). More importantly, this graphical representation illustrates that a confidence interval (or region, more generally) consists of population means that are likely to produce the observed sample mean. Thus, a confidence region represents possible null hypothesized population means that WOULD NOT BE rejected during hypothesis testing. A confidence region represents null hypothesized values that would NOT be rejected. Be clear that this statement is about precision. We cannot usually speak to accuracy because the true value of the parameter is usually unknown. More specifically the width of a confidence interval is two tmes the margin-of-error. Strictly, Z*=±1.645, but the sign is inconsequential due to squaring in the sample size formula.

Most of the material in Modules 13 and 15 is related to a 1-Sample Z-test, which is formalized in this module. Other specific hypothesis tests are in Modules 18-21. 17.1 11-Steps of Hypothesis Testing Hypothesis testing is a rigorous and formal procedure for making inferences about a parameter from a statistic. The 11 steps listed below will help make sure that all aspects important to hypothesis testing are completed. These steps should be used for all hypothesis tests in this and ensuing modules. State the rejection criterion (). State the null and alternative hypotheses to be tested and define the parameter(s). Identify (and explain why!) the hypothesis test to use (e.g., 1-Sample t, 2-sample t, etc.). Collect the data (address study type and if randomization occurred). Check all necessary assumptions (describe how you tested the validity). Calculate the appropriate statistic(s). Calculate the appropriate test statistic. Calculate the p-value. State your rejection decision about H0. Summarize your findings in terms of the problem. Compute and interpret an appropriate confidence region for the parameter. The order of some of these steps is arbitrary. However, Steps 1-3 MUST be completed before collecting data (Step 4). Further note that Step 11 is most important after H0 was rejected to provide a more definitive statement about the value of the parameter (i.e., if the parameter differs from the hypothesized value, then provide a range for which the actual parameter may exist). 17.2 1-Sample Z-Test Specifics A 1-Sample Z-Test tests H0:=0, where 0 represents a specific value of , when  is known. Other specifics of this test were discussed in previous modules and are summarized below. Hypothesis: H0:=0 Statistic: \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) Test Statistic: Z=\\(\\frac{\\bar{\\text{x}}-\\mu_{0}}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\text{n}}}}\\) Confidence Region: \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}+\\text{Z}^{*}\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\text{n}}}\\) Assumptions:  is known n30, n15 and the population is not strongly skewed, OR the population is normally distributed. Use with: Quantitative response, one group (or population),  known. The only test that can possibly be confused with a 1-Sample Z-Test is a 1-Sample t-Test (Module 18), which tests the same null hypothesis but when  is unknown. 17.3 Examples 17.3.1 Intra-class Travel Below are the 11-steps (Section 17.1) for completing a full hypothesis test for the following situation: A dean wants to determine if it takes more than 10 minutes, on average, to go between classes. To test this hypothesis, she collected a random sample of 100 intra-class travel times and found a mean of 10.12 mins. Assume from previous studies that the distribution of intra-class times is symmetric with a standard deviation of 1.60 mins. Test the deans hypothesis with =0.10. =0.10. H0:=10 mins vs. HA:&gt;10 mins, where  is the mean time for ALL intra-class travel events. A 1-Sample Z-Test is required because  a quantitative variable (intra-class travel time) was measured, individuals from one group (or population) is considered (students at the Deans school), and  is thought to be known (=1.60 mins). The data appear to be part of an observational study (the dean did not impart any conditions on the students) with a random selection of individuals. The assumptions are met because  n=10030, and  is thought to be known (=1.60 mins). \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)=10.12. Z=\\(\\frac{10.12-10}{\\frac{1.60}{\\sqrt{100}}}\\)=\\(\\frac{0.12}{0.16}\\)=0.75. p-value=0.2266. H0 is not rejected because the p-value&gt;=0.10. It appears that the mean time for all intra-class travel events is not more than 10 minutes. A 90% lower confidence bound will use Z*=-1.282. The lower confidence bound is thus 10.12-1.282×\\(\\frac{1.60}{\\sqrt{100}}\\)=9.91. Thus, I am 90% confident that the mean intra-class travel time is more than 9.91 minutes; further evidence that the mean intra-class travel time is not greater than 10 minutes.

When  is replaced by its estimator, s, the test statistic follows a Students t rather than a standard normal (Z) distribution. In this module, the t-distribution is described and a 1-Sample t-Test for testing that the mean from one population equals a specific value is discussed. 18.1 t-distribution A t-distribution is similar to a standard normal distribution (i.e., N(0,1)) in that it is centered on 0 and is bell shaped (Figure 18.1). The t-distribution differs from the standard normal distribution in that it is heavier in the tails, flatter near the center, and its exact dispersion is dictated by a quantity called the degrees-of-freedom (df). The t-distribution is flatter and fatter because of the uncertainty surrounding the use of s rather than  in the standard error calculation.66 The degrees-of-freedom are related to n and generally come from the denominator in the standard deviation calculation. As the degrees-of-freedom increase, the t-distribution becomes narrower, taller, and approaches the standard normal distribution (Figure 18.1). Figure 18.1: Standard normal (black) and t-distributions with varying degrees-of-freedom. Proportional areas on a t-distribution are computed using distrib() similar to what was described for a normal distribution in Modules 6 and 11. The major exceptions for using distrib() with a t-distribution is that distrib=\"t\" must be used and the degrees-of-freedom must be given in df= (how to find df is discussed in subsequent sections). For example, the area right of t=-1.456 on a t-distribution with 9 df is 0.9103 (Figure 18.2). ( distrib(-1.456,distrib=&quot;t&quot;,df=9,lower.tail=FALSE) ) Figure 18.2: Depiction of the area to the right of t=-1.456 on a t-distribution with 9 df. Similarly, the t with an upper-tail area of 0.95 on a t-distribution with 19 df is -1.729 (Figure 18.3).67 ( distrib(0.95,distrib=&quot;t&quot;,type=&quot;q&quot;,df=19,lower.tail=FALSE) ) Figure 18.3: Depiction of the value of t with an area to the right of 0.95 on a t-distribution with 19 df. 18.2 1-Sample t-Test Specifics A 1-Sample t-Test is similar to a 1-Sample Z-test in that both test the same H0. The difference, as discussed above, is that when  is replaced by s, the test statistic becomes t and the scaling factor for confidence regions becomes a t*. Other aspects are similar between the two tests as shown below.68 Hypothesis: H0:=0 Statistic: \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) Test Statistic: t=\\(\\frac{\\bar{\\text{x}}-\\mu_{0}}{\\frac{\\text{s}}{\\sqrt{\\text{n}}}}\\) Confidence Region: \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}+\\text{t}^{*}\\frac{\\text{s}}{\\sqrt{\\text{n}}}\\) df: n-1 Assumptions:  is UNknown n40, n15 and the sample (i.e., histogram) is not strongly skewed, OR the sample is normally distributed.

Below are the 11-steps (Section 17.1) for completing a full hypothesis test for the following situation: A prospective buyer will buy a catch of several thousand salmon if the mean weight of all salmon in the catch is at least 19.9 lbs. A random selection of 50 salmon had a mean of 20.1 and a standard deviation of 0.76 lbs. Should the buyer accept the catch at the 5% level? =0.05. H0:=19.9 lbs vs. HA: &gt;19.9 lbs where  is the mean weight of ALL salmon in the catch. A 1-Sample t-Test is required because  a quantitative variable (weight) was measured, individuals from one group (or population) were considered (this catch of salmon), and  is UNknown.69 The data appear to be part of an observational study with random selection. The assumptions are met because  n=5040 and  is unknown. \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) = 20.1 lbs (and s = 0.76 lbs). t = \\(\\frac{20.1-19.9}{\\frac{0.76}{\\sqrt{50}}}\\) = \\(\\frac{0.2}{0.107}\\) = 1.87 with df = 50-1 = 49. p-value = 0.0337. H0: is rejected because the p-value &lt;. The average weight of ALL salmon in this catch appears to be greater than 19.9 lbs; thus, the buyer should accept this catch of salmon. I am 95% confident that the mean weight of ALL salmon in the catch is greater than 19.92 lbs (i.e., 20.1-1.677×\\(\\frac{0.76}{\\sqrt{50}}\\) = 20.1-0.18 = 19.92).

(1992) critically examined the belief that the mean body temperature is 98.6oF by measuring body temperatures in a sample of healthy humans. Use their results in Table 18.1 to determine at the 1% level if the mean body temperature differs from 98.6oF. Table 18.1: Descriptive statistics from measuring the body temperature of a sample of healthy humans. n mean sd min Q1 median Q3 max 130 98.25 0.73 96.3 97.8 98.3 98.7 100.8 =0.01. H0:=98.6oF vs. HA:98.6oF, where  is the mean body temperature for ALL healthy humans. [Note that not equals was used because the researchers want to determine if the temperature is different from \\(98.6\\)oF.] A 1-Sample t-Test is required because  a quantitative variable (i.e., body temperature) was measured, individuals from one group (or population) is considered (i.e., healthy humans), and  is unknown (i.e., not given in the background). The data appear to be part of an observational study although this is not made clear in the background information. There is also no evidence that randomization was used. The assumptions are met because  n=13040 and  is unknown. \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\) = 98.25oF. t = \\(\\frac{98.25-98.6}{\\frac{0.73}{\\sqrt{130}}}\\) = \\(\\frac{-0.35}{0.064}\\) = -5.469 with df = 130-1 = 129. p-value=0.0000002. [Note that the result of distrib() is multiplied by 2 because of the not equals HA.] Reject H0 because p-value&lt;=0.01. It appears that the mean body temperature of ALL healthy humans is less than 98.6oF. [Note that the test was for a difference but because \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)&lt;98.6 this more specific conclusion can be made.] I am 99% confident that the mean body temperature () for ALL healthy humans is between 98.08oC (=98.25-2.614×0.064) and 98.42oC (=98.25+2.614×0.064). [Note that the area in distrib() is \\(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\) because of the not equals HA:.] R Appendix: ( pval &lt;- 2*distrib(-5.469,distrib=&quot;t&quot;,df=129) ) (tstar &lt;- distrib(0.995,distrib=&quot;t&quot;,df=129,type=&quot;q&quot;) ) Recall that the sample standard deviation is a statistic and is thus subject to sampling variability. This reverse calculation would be t* for a 95% lower confidence bound. Compare these specifics to those for a 1-Sample Z-test in Section 17.2. If  is given, then it will appear in the background information to the question and will be in a sentence that uses the words population, assume that, or suppose that. "],["t2test.html", "Module 19 2-Sample t-Test 19.1 2-Sample t-Test Specifics 19.2 Testing for Equal Variances 19.3 Examples", " Module 19 2-Sample t-Test While it is often useful to test whether a population mean differs from a specific value (i.e., with the 1-Sample t-Test of Module 18), there are many instances where interest is in whether means from two groups (or populations) differ. For example, is there a difference in mean income between males and females, in mean test scores between students from high- and low-income families, in mean percent body fat between raccoons from southern and northern Wisconsin, or in mean amount of milk produced from cows provided with a hormone or a placebo. In all of these situations, interest is in identifying if a difference in population means exists between two groups (males and females, students from high- and low-income families, raccoons from southern and northern Wisconsin, cows given a hormone or a placebo). A 2-Sample t-Test is used in these situations and is the subject of this module. 19.1 2-Sample t-Test Specifics In a 2-Sample t-Test, H0:1=2 states that the two population means are equal. This can be rewritten as H0:1-2=0, because the difference between two population means is zero if the two population means are equal. With this H0, the parameter is 1-2 and the corresponding statistic is \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)1-\\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)2. Thus, a 2-Sample t-Test is focused on the difference in population means. When looking at the general test statistic formula (see Section 14.3) of \\[ \\text{Test Statistic} = \\frac{\\text{Observed Statistic}-\\text{Hypothesized Parameter}}{SE_{\\text{Statistic}}} \\] it is apparent that the SE of \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)1-\\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)2 (i.e., the statistic) is needed. Unfortunately, the calculation of this standard error depends on whether the two population variances are equal or not. When the variances are approximately equal (discussed in Section 19.2), the standard error of \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)1-\\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)2 is \\[ \\text{SE}_{\\bar{\\text{x}}_{1}-\\bar{\\text{x}}_{2}}= \\sqrt{\\text{s}_{\\text{p}}^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\text{n}_{1}}+\\frac{1}{\\text{n}_{2}} \\right)} \\] where n1 and n2 are the sample sizes for the two groups and \\(\\text{s}_{\\text{p}}^{2}\\) is the pooled sample variance computed as a weighted average of the two sample variances (\\(\\text{s}_{1}^{2}\\) and \\(\\text{s}_{2}^{2}\\)), or \\[ \\text{s}_{\\text{p}}^{2}=\\frac{(\\text{n}_{1}-1)\\text{s}_{1}^{2}+(\\text{n}_{2}-1)\\text{s}_{2}^{2}}{\\text{n}_{1}+\\text{n}_{2}-2} \\] The degrees-of-freedom for the 2-Sample t-Test with equal variances come from the denominator of the pooled variance calculation; i.e., df=n1+n2-2. The specifics of the 2-Sample t-Test are below. Hypothesis: H0:1-2=0 Statistic: \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)1-\\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)2 Test Statistic: t=\\(\\frac{\\bar{\\text{x}}_{1}-\\bar{\\text{x}}_{2}-0}{\\sqrt{\\text{s}_{\\text{p}}^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\text{n}_{1}}+\\frac{1}{\\text{n}_{2}} \\right)}}\\) where \\(\\text{s}_{\\text{p}}^{2}=\\frac{(\\text{n}_{1}-1)\\text{s}_{1}^{2}+(\\text{n}_{2}-1)\\text{s}_{2}^{2}}{\\text{n}_{1}+\\text{n}_{2}-2}\\). Confidence Region: \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)1-\\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)2+t*\\(\\sqrt{\\text{s}_{\\text{p}}^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\text{n}_{1}}+\\frac{1}{\\text{n}_{2}} \\right)}\\) df: n1+n2-2 Assumptions: n1+n240, n1+n215 and each sample (i.e., histogram) is not strongly skewed, OR each sample is normally distributed. Variances are equal, Samples are independent, Use with: Quantitative response, two groups (or populations), individuals are independent between groups. The \\(\\text{s}_{\\text{p}^{2}}\\) calculation can be checked by determining if the value of \\(\\text{s}_{\\text{p}}^{2}\\) is between \\(\\text{s}_{1}^{2}\\) and \\(\\text{s}_{2}^{2}\\) or if the value of \\(\\sqrt{\\text{s}_{\\text{p}}^{2}}\\) is between \\(\\text{s}_{1}\\) and \\(\\text{s}_{2}\\). A 2-Sample t-Test is often used to test an alternative hypothesis of simply finding a difference between the two groups. However, if the null hypothesis is rejected in these instances (thus, identifying a significant difference between the two groups), then care should be taken to specifically describe how the two groups differ. If the statistic is negative, then the mean of the first group is lower than the mean of the second group and, if the statistic is positive, then the mean of the first group is larger than the mean of the second group. The values of the confidence region should be used to identify how much larger or smaller the mean from one group is compared to the mean of the other group. A confidence interval is used to specifically explain how much larger or smaller one mean is than the other mean. 19.2 Testing for Equal Variances As noted above, the methods of a 2-Sample t-Test differ depending on whether the two population variances are equal or not. This should present a problem to you because the population variances are parameters and are typically not known.70 The question of whether these parameters are equal or not is answered with a hypothesis test, as has been done with all other questions about parameters. A Levenes Test is used to determine whether two population variances are equal. The specifics of the Levenes test are not examined in detail here, rather you only need to know that H0:\\(\\sigma_{1}^{2}=\\sigma_{2}^{2}\\) is tested against HA:\\(\\sigma_{1}^{2}\\neq\\sigma_{2}^{2}\\). We will use computer software to compute the p-value for this test (without further detail). If the Levenes Test p-value &lt;, then H0 is rejected and the population variances are considered unequal. If the p-value &gt;, then H0 is not rejected and the population variances are considered equal. 19.3 Examples 19.3.1 Corn and Fertilizers Below are the 11-steps (Section 17.1) for completing a full hypothesis test for the following situation: An agricultural researcher thought that corn plants grown in pots exposed to a certain type of synthetic fertilizer would grow taller than plants exposed to an organic fertilizer. To collect data to test this idea, he grew 50 corn plants in individual pots  25 were treated with organic fertilizer and 25 were treated with synthetic fertilizer. Each pot contained soil from a well-mixed common source and was planted in the same greenhouse. Each plant was similar in all regards (similar genetics, age, etc.). Use the results (heights of individual plants) in Table 19.1 and a Levenes Test p of 0.1341 to test the researchers hypothesis at the 5% level. Table 19.1: Summary statistics of the corn plant height in two treatments. Group Mean SD Synthetic 51.46 5.975 Organic 47.49 6.721  = 0.05. H0:o-s = 0 vs HA:o-s &lt; 0, where  is the mean plant height, o represents organic fertilizer, and s represents synthetic fertilizer. [Note that negative differences represent larger values for synthetic fertilizer; thus, HA represents synthetic fertilizer producing taller plants.] A 2-Sample t-Test is required because  a quantitative variable (height) was measured, two groups are being compared (synthetic and organic fertilizers), and plants in the two groups were INdependent as the plants were not paired, plants were not tested over time, etc. The data appear to be part of an experiment (the researcher imposed the treatments on the plants) with no clear indication of random selection of plants or random allocation of plants to the two treatments. The assumptions are met as shown below. no+ns = 5040, individuals in the two groups are independent as discussed above, and the population variances appear to be equal because the Levenes Test p-value (0.1341) is &gt;. \\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)o-\\(\\bar{\\text{x}}\\)s = 47.79 - 51.46 = -3.97. Additionally, \\(\\text{s}_{\\text{p}}^{2}=\\frac{(25-1)6.721^{2}+(25-1)5.975^{2}}{25+25-2}\\) = 40.44 and \\(\\text{SE}_{\\bar{\\text{x}}_{\\text{o}}-\\bar{\\text{x}}_{\\text{s}}}=\\sqrt{40.44\\left(\\frac{1}{25}+\\frac{1}{25} \\right)}\\) = 1.799. t = \\(\\frac{-3.97-0}{1.799}\\) = \\(\\frac{-3.97}{1.799}\\) = -2.207 with 25+25-2 = 48 df. p-value = 0.0161. H0 is rejected because the p-value&lt;. The average height of the corn plants appears to be greater for plants grown with synthetic fertilizer than for plants grown with organic fertilizer. I am 95% confident that plants grown with synthetic fertilizer are more than 0.95 cm taller, on average, than plants grown with the organic fertilizer.

Over a one-month period, 32 patients had a tooth removed while listening to music and 36 had a tooth removed without listening to music. Each patient was given a questionnaire following the extraction. Answers to the questionnaire were converted to a numeric scale to measure the patients level of anxiety (larger numbers mean more anxiety). For those given background music, the mean anxiety level was 4.2 (with a standard deviation of 1.2), while the group without music had a mean of 5.9 (with a standard deviation of 1.9). The surgeon also reported a Levenes test p-value of 0.089. Test the surgeons hypothesis at the 5% level.  = 0.05. H0:w-wo=0 vs HA:w-wo&lt;0, where  is the mean anxiety level, w represents patients with, and wo represents without music. [Note that negative numbers represent lower anxiety values in patients in the with music treatment. Thus, HA suggests lower anxiety in patients with music.] A 2-Sample t-Test is required because  a quantitative variable (anxiety level) was measured, two groups are being compared (music or no music), and individuals in the two groups are independent (i.e., they were not paired, were not otherwise related, etc.).

"],["ChiSquare.html", "Module 20 Chi-Square Test 20.1 Chi-Square Distribution 20.2 Chi-Square Test Specifics 20.3 Examples", " Module 20 Chi-Square Test Situations where a categorical response variable is recorded would be summarized with a frequency or percentage table (see Modules 4 and 10). The appropriate test statistic in these situations is a chi-square rather than a t. The Chi-Square Test test statistic follows a chi-square distribution, which is introduced below. The rest of this module is dedicated to the general Chi-Square Test where the distribution of a categorical response variable is compared between two or more groups (or populations). The related goodness-of-fit test for a categorical response recorded for only one group (or population) is introduced in Module 21. 20.1 Chi-Square Distribution A chi-square (2) distribution is generally right-skewed (Figure 20.1), with the exact shape dictated by the degrees-of-freedom (df); as the df increase the sharpness of the skew decreases (Figure 20.1). Figure 20.1: \\(\\chi^2\\) distributions with varying degrees-of-freedom. In its simplest form, the 2 distribution arises as a sampling distribution for the 2 test statistic, \\[ \\chi^{2} = \\sum_{cells}\\frac{(Observed-Expected)^{2}}{Expected} \\] where Observed and Expected represent the observed and expected counts in the cells of frequency tables (see Module 4 and Module 10). Thus, the 2 distribution arises from comparing frequencies in two tables.71 Unlike the normal and t distributions, the 2 distribution always represents the two-tailed situation, although the two tails will appear as one tail on the right side of the distribution. The simplest explanation for this characteristic is that the squaring in the calculation of the 2 test statistic results in what would be a negative tail being folded over onto what is the positive tail. Thus, all probability (i.e., area) calculations on a 2 distribution represent the two-tailed alternative hypotheses. Proportional areas on a 2 distribution are computed with disrib(). The major differences with a 2 distribution is that distrib=\"chisq\" must be used in distrib() and the degrees-of-freedom must be given to df=.72 In addition, lower.tail=FALSE is always used when computing a p-value because the upper-tail probability represents the two-tailed alternative hypothesis inherent to all Chi-Square Tests. For example, the area right of 2=6.456 on a 2 distribution with 2 df is 0.0396 (Figure 20.2). ( distrib(6.456,distrib=&quot;chisq&quot;,df=2,lower.tail=FALSE) ) Figure 20.2: Depiction of the area to the right of \\(\\chi^2=6.456\\) on a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with 2 df. 20.2 Chi-Square Test Specifics Researchers commonly want to compare the distribution of individuals into the levels of a categorical variable among two or more groups (or populations). For example, researchers may want to determine if the distribution of failing students differs between males and females, if the distribution of kids playing sports differs between kids from high- or low-income families, if the distribution of four major plant species differs between two locations, or if the distribution of responses to a five-choice question differs between respondents from neighboring counties. All of these questions have a categorical response variable (fail or not, play sport or not, plant species, answer to five-choice question) compared among two or more groups (gender, income category, two locations, neighboring counties). The Chi-Square Test, the subject of this module, can be used for each of these situations.73 20.2.1 Hypotheses The statistical hypotheses for a Chi-Square Test are wordy. To explore this, lets first assume that a two-way frequency table (see Module 10) will summarize the data where the rows correspond to separate groups and the columns correspond to levels of the response variable. In this organization, the Chi-Square Test null hypothesis is that the row percentages are equal  i.e., the percentage distribution of individuals into the levels of the response variable is the same for all groups. The alternative hypothesis states that there is some difference among the row percentages  i.e., the percentage distribution of individuals into the levels of the response variable is NOT the same for all groups. As one example (more are shown below), consider the following: An association of Christmas tree growers in Indiana sponsored a survey of Indiana households to help improve the marketing of Christmas trees. Of the 261 rural households, 64 had a natural tree (as compared to an artificial tree). Of the 160 urban households, 89 had a natural tree. Use these results to determine, at the 10% level, if the distribution of households with a natural tree differed between rural and urban households. The hypotheses for this situation are, H0: the distrubution of households into the tree types is the same for urban and rural households HA: the distrubution of households into the tree types is NOT the same for urban and rural households 20.2.2 Tables As noted above, all two-way frequency tables used for a Chi-Square Test will be organized such that the response variable forms the columns and the groups to be compared form the rows. With this organization, the row-percentage table becomes the table of primary interest because it relates directly to the hypotheses described above. The question of a Chi-Square Test then becomes one of determining whether each row of the row-percentage table is equal, given sampling variability. The observed raw data must be organized into a two-way frequency table as described in Module 10. For example, the Christmas tree data is summarized as in Table 20.1. The actual calculations for a Chi-Square Test are performed on this observed table. However, the hypothesis test, as described above, is best viewed as a method to determine if each row of the row-percentage table is statistically equivalent or not. Thus, the row-percentage table computed from the frequency table is useful when interpreting the results of a Chi-Square Test (Table 20.2). Table 20.1: Frequency of individuals in urban and rural households that have a natural or an artificial Christmas tree. Natural Artificial Sum Urban 89 172 261 Rural 64 96 160 Sum 153 268 421 Table 20.2: Percentage of individuals within urban and rural households that have a natural or an artificial Christmas tree. Natural Artificial Sum Urban 34.1 65.9 100 Rural 40.0 60.0 100 ALL 36.3 63.7 100 The Chi-Square Test requires constructing a table of expected values that are derived from the null hypothesis. Specifically, the expected table contains the expected frequency of individuals in each level of the response variable for each group assuming that the distribution of responses does not differ among groups. These expected tables are computed from the margins of the observed table, but are best explained with an illustrative example. In the Christmas tree example, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference in the distribution of households with a natural tree between the rural and urban areas. Thus, under this null hypothesis, one would expect the proportion (or percentage) of households with a natural tree to be the same in both groups. The proportion of households with a natural tree, regardless of location, is \\(\\frac{153}{421}\\)=0.363. Thus, under the null hypothesis, the proportion of rural AND the proportion of urban households with a natural tree is 0.363. Because there is a different number of urban and rural households in the study, the actual NUMBER (rather than proportion) of households expected to have a natural tree will differ. The NUMBER of urban households expected to HAVE a natural tree is found by multiplying the number of urban households by the common proportion computed above  i.e., 261×0.363=94.743. The remaining urban households would be expected to NOT have a natural tree  i.e., 261-94.743=261×(1-0.363)=166.257. Similar calculations are made for the rural households (i.e., 160×0.363=58.080 expected to have a natural tree and 160×(1-0.363)=101.920 expected to NOT have a natural tree. These expected frequencies are computed directly and easily from the marginal totals of the observed frequency table (Table 20.1). For example, substituting the fractional representation of the decimal proportions into the calculation of the expected number of urban households with a natural tree gives 261×\\(\\frac{153}{421}\\)=\\(\\frac{261\\times153}{421}\\)=94.85374. A close examination of this formula and the marginal totals in Table 20.1 shows that this value is equal to the product of the corresponding row and column marginal totals in the observed table divided by the total number of individuals. The other expected values follow a similar pattern as follows, 261×\\(\\frac{268}{421}=\\frac{261\\times268}{421}\\)=166.147 urban households to NOT have a natural tree. 160×\\(\\frac{153}{421}=\\frac{160\\times153}{421}\\)=58.147 rural households to have a natural tree. 160×\\(\\frac{268}{421}=\\frac{160\\times268}{421}\\)=101.853 rural households to NOT have a natural tree. Thus, all expected values in a Chi-Square Test are calculated by multiplying the row and column totals of the frequency table and dividing by the total number of individuals. These expected values are summarized in a two-way table, called the expected frequencies table (Table 20.3) Table 20.3: Expected frequency of individuals in urban and rural households that have a natural or an artificial Christmas tree. Natural Artificial Sum Urban 94.853 166.147 261 Rural 58.147 101.853 160 Sum 153.000 268.000 421 20.2.3 Specifics The Chi-Square Test is characterized by a categorical response variable recorded for two or more groups (or populations). The specifics of the Chi-Square Test are below. Null Hypothesis: The distribution of individuals into the levels of the response variable is the same for all groups Alternative Hypothesis: The distribution of individuals into the levels of the response variable is NOT the same for all groups. Statistic: Observed frequency table. Test Statistic: 2=\\(\\sum_{\\text{cells}}\\frac{(\\text{Observed}-\\text{Expected})^{2}}{\\text{Expected}}\\) df: (r-1)×(c-1) where r is number of rows and c is the number of columns Assumptions: Expected value for each category is 5. Use with: Categorical response, two or more groups (or populations). A confidence region is not usually constructed for a Chi-Square Test because of the complexity of the statistics and parameter. Thus, Step 11 for a hypothesis test will not be computed for a Chi-Square Test. 20.3 Examples 20.3.1 Christmas Trees Below are the 11-steps (Section 17.1) for a full hypothesis test for the Christmas tree example introduced above. =0.10. H0: distribution of households by type of tree is the same for urban and rural households vs. HA: distribution of households by type of tree is NOT the same for urban and rural households. A Chi-Square Test is required because  a categorical response variable was recorded (type of tree) and two groups are being compared (urban and rural households). The data appear to be part of an observational study with no clear indication of randomization. The expected frequency in each of the four cells is greater than five (Table 20.3). The observed frequency table is in Table 20.1. 2 = \\(\\frac{(89-94.853)^{2}}{94.853}\\) + \\(\\frac{(172-166.147)^{2}}{166.147}\\) + \\(\\frac{(64-58.147)^{2}}{58.147}\\) + \\(\\frac{(96-101.853)^{2}}{101.853}\\) = 0.3611+0.2062+0.5891+0.3363 = 1.4927 with 1 df. p-value=0.2218. H0 is not rejected because the p-value is &gt;. There does not appear to be a significant difference in the distribution of Christmas tree types among rural and urban households. Not performed for Chi-Square Test.

The researchers recorded the time of the day and the main activity of the group, whether traveling quickly, feeding, or socializing. The number of dolphin groups observed by each time of day and activity is shown in Table 20.4. Use this information to determine, at the 5% level if the proportion of groups exhibiting each activity differs by time of day. Table 20.4: Observed frequencies of dolphin observations in each activity type and time of day.

The H0: The distribution of dolphin groups into each activity type is the same among times of day versus HA: The disribution of dolphin groups into each activity type is NOT the same among times of day. A chi-square test is required because a categorical variable with three levels (activity type) was measured and four groups (times of day) are being compared. An observational study that is not obviously a random sample was used. The test statistic below will follow a 2 distribution because the expected number in each cell is greater than five (Table 20.5). Table 20.5: Expected frequencies of dolphin observations in each activity type and time of day. Travel Feed Social Sum Morning 15.6 32.6 23.8 72 Noon 5.6 11.8 8.6 26 Afternoon 5.6 11.8 8.6 26 Evening 17.1 35.8 26.1 79 Sum 44.0 92.0 67.0 203 The table of observed values is in Table 20.4.

The p-value for this test statistic is &lt;0.00005 (more specifically it is 8.7e-13). The H0 is rejected because the p-value &lt; . There appears to be a difference in the distribution of dolphin groups into each activity type among the four times of day. In fact, it appears that dolphins tend to socialize more in the mornings, travel during the noon and afternoon periods, and feed in the evenings (Table 20.6). Table 20.6: The percentage of dolphin observations in each activity type by time of day. Travel Feed Social Sum Morning 8.3 38.9 52.8 100.0 Noon 38.5 26.9 34.6 100.0 Afternoon 57.7 3.8 38.5 100.0 Evening 16.5 70.9 12.7 100.1 Not needed for a chi-square test. R Appendix: distrib(68.400,distrib=&quot;chisq&quot;,df=6,lower.tail=FALSE) Subsequent sections demonstrate how this test statistic is used to compare observed frequencies (i.e., from a sample) to expected frequencies (i.e., from a null hypothesis). How to find the df will be discussed in subsequent sections. The Chi-Square Test is quite flexible and can be derived from different types of hypotheses than those described here. Note a slight difference here because 0.363 was rounded to three decimals, whereas the fraction is not rounded. "],["GOFTest.html", "Module 21 Goodness-of-Fit Test 21.1 Goodness-of-Fit Test Specifics 21.2 Examples", " Module 21 Goodness-of-Fit Test It is common to determine if the frequency of individuals in the levels of a categorical response variable follow frequencies suggested by a particular theory or distribution. The simplest of these situations occurs when a researcher is making a hypothesis about the percentage or proportion of individuals in one of two categories. The distribution of individuals in two categories comes from the proportion in the hypothesis for one category and one minus the proportion in the hypothesis for the other category. In situations with more than two levels, the distribution of individuals into the categories likely comes from the hypothesis that a particular theoretical distribution holds true. For example, a researcher may want to determine if frequencies predicted from a certain genetic theory are upheld by the observed frequencies found in a breeding experiment, if the frequency that a certain animal uses habitats is in proportion to the availability of those habitats, or if the frequency of consumers that show a preference for a certain product (over other comparable products) is non-random. In each of these cases, the theoretical distribution articulated in the research hypothesis must be converted to statistical hypotheses that will then be used to generate expected frequencies for each level. These expected frequencies will then be statistically compared to the observed frequencies to determine if the theoretical distribution represented in the null hypothesis is supported by the data. The method used for comparing the observed to expected frequencies, where the expected frequencies come from a hypothesized theoretical distribution, is a Goodness-of-Fit Test, the subject of this module. 21.1 Goodness-of-Fit Test Specifics 21.1.1 The Hypotheses A Goodness-of-Fit Test is used when a single categorical variable has been recorded and the frequency of individuals in the levels of this variable are to be compared to a theoretical distribution. In its most general form the statistical hypotheses for the Goodness-of-Fit Test will be wordy, relating whether the distribution of individuals into the levels of the response variable follows a specific theoretical distribution or not. The null hypothesis will generally be like H0:the distribution of individuals into the levels follows the theoretical distribution, where theoretical distribution will likely be replaced with more specific language. For example, the research hypothesis that states that 50% of students at Northland are from Wisconsin, 25% are from neighboring states, and 25% are from other states would be converted to H0:the proportion of students from Wisconsin, neighboring states, and other states is 0.50, 0.25, and 0.25, respectively with an HA:the proportion of students from Wisconsin, neighboring states, and other states is NOT 0.50, 0.25, and 0.25, respectively. The hypotheses are simpler, but you must be more careful, when there are only two levels of the response variable. For example, a research hypothesis of less than 40% of new-born bear cubs are female would be converted to H0:the proportion of bear cubs that are female and male is 0.40 and 0.60, respectively with an HA:the proportion of bear cubs that are female and male is NOT 0.40 and 0.60, respectively. However, these hypotheses are often simplified to focus on only one level as the other level is implied by subtraction from one. Thus, these hypotheses are more likely to be written as H0:the proportion of bear cubs that are female is 0.40 with an HA:the proportion of bear cubs that are female is NOT 0.40. One may also have expected, from the wording of the research hypothesis about the sex of bear cubs, that the alternative hypothesis would have been HA:the proportion of bear cubs that are female is LESS THAN 0.40. Recall from Section 20.1, however, that the chi-square test statistic always represents a two-tailed situation. Thus, the H0 here reflects that constraint. The researcher will ultimately be able to determine if the proportion is less than 0.40 if the p-value from the Goodness-of-Fit Test indicates a difference and the observed proportion of female bear cubs is less than 0.40. 21.1.2 The Tables For a Goodness-of-Fit Test, the data are summarized in an observed frequency table as in Module 4. Additionally, a table of expected frequencies must be constructed from the theoretical distribution in the null hypothesis and the total number of observed individuals (n). Specifically, the expected frequencies are found by multiplying the expected proportions from the theoretical distribution in the null hypothesis by n. For example, consider this situation: Bath and Buchanan (1989) surveyed residents of Wyoming by distributing a mailing to random residents and collecting voluntarily returned surveys. One question asked of the respondents was, Do you strongly agree, agree, neither agree or disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree with this statement?  Wolves would have a significant impact on big game hunting opportunities near Yellowstone National Park. The researchers hypothesized that more than 50% of Wyoming residents would either disagree or strongly disagree with the statement. Of the 371 residents that returned the survey, 153 disagreed and 43 strongly disagreed with the statement. At first glance it may seem that this variable has five levels  i.e., the levels of agreement offered in the actual survey. However, the researchers hypothesis collapsed the results of the survey question into two levels: (1) strongly disagree or disagree combined and (2) all other responses. Thus, the statistical hypotheses for this situation are H0:the proportion of respondents that disagreed or strongly disagreed is 0.50 and HA:the proportion of respondents that disagreed or strongly disagreed is NOT 0.50. The expected frequencies in each level are derived from the total number of individuals examined and the specific null hypothesis. For example, if the null hypothesis is true, then 50% of the 371 respondents would be expected to disagree or strongly disagree with the statement. In other words, 371×0.50=185.5 individuals would be expected to disagree or strongly disagree. Furthermore, the other 50%, or 371×(1-0.50)=185.5 would be expected to not disagree or strongly disagree. These expectations are summarized in Table 21.1. Table 21.1: Expected and observed frequency of respondents that disagreed or strongly disagreed (i.e., labeled as Disagree) with the given statement in the Wyoming survey example. Category Expected Observed Disagree 185.5 196 Not Disagree 185.5 175 Sum 371.0 371 The expected table should maintain at least one decimal in each cell even though the values represent frequencies. Consider the following situation where construction of expected frequencies is bit more complex. Mendels law of independent assortment predicts that the phenotypes (i.e., how they look) of the offspring from mating the offspring of a dihybrid cross of homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive parents should follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio. In an experiment to test this, Mendel crossed a pea plant that produces round, yellow seeds (i.e., all dominant alleles, YYWW) with a pea plant that produces green, wrinkled seeds (i.e., all recessive alleles, yyww) such that only round, yellow heterozygous offspring (i.e., YyWw) were produced. Pairs of these offspring were then bred. Mendels theory says that \\(\\frac{9}{16}\\) of these offspring should be round, yellow; \\(\\frac{3}{16}\\) should be round, green; \\(\\frac{3}{16}\\) should be wrinkled, yellow; and \\(\\frac{1}{16}\\) should be wrinkled, green. Of 566 seeds studied in this experiment, Mendel found that 315 were round, yellow; 108 were round, green; 101 were wrinkled, yellow; and 32 were wrinkled, green. Use these results to determine, at the 5% level, if Mendels law of independent assortment is supported by these results. The statistical hypotheses are as follows, H0:the proportion of RY, RG, WY, and WG individuals will be \\(\\frac{9}{16}\\), \\(\\frac{3}{16}\\), \\(\\frac{3}{16}\\), and \\(\\frac{1}{16}\\), respectively HA:the proportion of RY, RG, WY, and WG individuals will NOT be \\(\\frac{9}{16}\\), \\(\\frac{3}{16}\\), \\(\\frac{3}{16}\\), and \\(\\frac{1}{16}\\), respectively where RY=round, yellow, RG=round, green, WY=wrinkled, yellow, and WG=wrinkled, green. If these proportions are applied to the n=566 observed offspring, then the following frequencies for each phenotype would be expected: \\(\\frac{9}{16}\\)×566 = 318.375 would be expected to be round, yellow. \\(\\frac{3}{16}\\)×566 = 106.125 would be expected to be round, green. \\(\\frac{3}{16}\\)×566 = 106.125 would be expected to be wrinkled, yellow. \\(\\frac{1}{16}\\)×566 = 35.375 would be expected to be wrinkled, green. These expected frequencies are summarized in Table 21.2. Table 21.2: Expected and observed frequency of 566 pea seeds in four types. Category Expected Observed round, yellow 318.375 314 round, green 106.125 108 wrinkled, yellow 106.125 101 wrinkled, green 35.375 32 Sum 566.000 566 The hypothesis test method developed in the following sections will be used to determine if the differences between the expected and observed frequencies are large enough to suggest that the observed frequencies do not support the distribution represented in the null hypothesis. 21.1.3 Specifics The Goodness-of-Fit Test is characterized by a single categorical response variable. The hypotheses tested usually cannot be converted to mathematical symbols and are thus wordy. Specifics of the Goodness-of-Fit Test are below. Hypotheses: H0: the observed distribution of individuals into the levels follows the `theoretical distribution vs HA: the observed distribution of individuals into the levels DOES NOT follow the theoretical distribution. Statistic: Observed frequency table. Test Statistic: \\(\\chi^{2} = \\sum_{\\text{cells}}\\frac{(\\text{Observed-Expected)}^{2}}{\\text{Expected}}\\) df: Number of levels minus 1. Assumptions: Expected value in each level is 5. Confidence Interval (for one level): \\(\\hat{\\text{p}}\\) ± Z*\\(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\text{p}}(1-\\hat{\\text{p}})}{\\text{n}}}\\) Use with: Categorical response, one group (or population), comparing to a theoretical distribution. It is cumbersome to produce a confidence interval in a Goodness-of-Fit Test because there generally is not a single parameter (i.e., there are as many parameters as levels in the response variable). Confidence intervals can be calculated for the proportions in each level as shown below. However, confidence intervals will only be hand-calculated when there are two levels. When using R (as discussed in a later module), confidence intervals will be computed for all levels, no matter the number of levels. Let p be the population proportion in a particular level and \\(\\hat{\\text{p}}\\) be the sample proportion in the same interval. The \\(\\hat{\\text{p}}\\) is computed by dividing the frequency of individuals in this level by the total number of individuals in the sample (i.e., n). The \\(\\hat{\\text{p}}\\) is a statistic that is subject to sampling variable with that sampling variability measured by \\(\\text{SE}_{\\hat{\\text{p}}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\text{p}}(1-\\hat{\\text{p}})}{\\text{n}}}\\) for large values of n. For large values of n the \\(\\hat{\\text{p}}\\) will follow a normal distribution such that a confidence interval for p is computed using the general confidence interval formula found in Section 15.2 and repeated below: \\[ \\text{&quot;Statistic&quot;} + \\text{&quot;scaling factor&quot;} * \\text{SE}_{\\text{statistic}} \\] where the scaling factor is the familiar Z*. Thus, the confidence interval for p is constructed with \\[ \\hat{\\text{p}} \\pm \\text{Z}^{*}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\text{p}}(1-\\hat{\\text{p}})}{\\text{n}}} \\] Note that one does not need to worry about lower and upper bounds, only confidence intervals will be computed, because of the two-tailed nature of the chi-square test statistic. In the Wyoming survey example, the proportion of respondents in the sample that either disagreed or strongly disagreed was \\(\\hat{\\text{p}}\\)=\\(\\frac{196}{371}\\)=0.528. The standard error for this sample proportion is \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{0.528(1-0.528)}{371}}\\)=0.026. For a 95% confidence interval, Z*=±1.960.75 Thus, the confidence interval is 0.528±1.960×0.026 or 0.528±0.051 or (0.477,0.579). Therefore, one is 95% confident that the population proportion that either disagreed or strongly disagreed is between 0.477 and 0.579. Because there are only two levels in this example it can also be said with 95% confidence that the population proportion that did not either disagree or strongly disagree is between 0.421 and 0.523. 21.2 Examples 21.2.1 $1 Coins Below are the 11-steps (Section 17.1) for completing a full hypothesis test for the following situation: USA Today (June 14, 1995) reported that 77% of the population opposes replacing $1 bills with $1 coins. To test if this claim holds true for the residents of Ashland a student selected a sample of 80 Ashland residents and found that 54 were opposed to replacing the bills with coins. Develop a hypothesis test (at the 10% level) to determine if the proportion of Ashland residents that are opposed to replacing bills with coins is different from the proportion opposed for the general population. =0.10. H0:the proportion of Ashland residents that oppose replacing the $1 bill with the $1 coin is 0.77 vs. HA: The proportion of Ashland residents that oppose replacing the $1 bill with the $1 coin is NOT 0.77. A Goodness-of-Fit Test is required because  a single categorical variable was recorded (opinion about $1 coin), a single group (or population) was considered (Ashland residents), and the frequency of responses is being compared to a hypothesized distribution in the null hypothesis. The data appear to be part of an observational study with no clear indication of random selection of individuals. The expected number in the oppose level is 80×0.77=61.6. The expected number in the do not oppose category is 80×0.23=18.4. These expectations are shown in the table below. The assumption of more than five individual in all cells of the expected table has been met.

H0 is rejected because the p-value&lt;=0.10. The proportion of Ashland residents that oppose replacing the $1 bill with the $1 coin does appear to be different from the proportion (0.77) reported for the general population. I am 90% confident that the proportion of all Ashland residents opposed to the $1 coin is between 0.596 and 0.767 [i.e., \\(\\frac{54}{80}\\)±1.645×\\(\\sqrt{\\frac{0.68125*0.31875}{80}}\\)=0.68125±1.645*times;0.0521$=0.68125±0.0857=(0.5956,0.7670).] R Appendix: ( distrib(3.292,distrib=&quot;chisq&quot;,df=1,lower.tail=FALSE) ) ( distrib(0.95,type=&quot;q&quot;) ) 21.2.2 Cola Taste Test A random selection of consumers present at the Mall of America were allowed to taste three types of cola (Pepsi, Coke, and a generic brand). After tasting each type (which were supplied to each person in a random order) the person was to select which cola they preferred. The results indicated that 57 people preferred Pepsi, 63 preferred Coke, and 34 preferred the generic brand. Is there evidence, at the 5% level, that these customers prefer one brand over the others?  = 0.05. The H0: The distribution of individuals is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) (i.e., no preference) for each cola type versus HA: The distribution of individuals is note \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) (i.e., no preference) for each cola type. A goodness-of-fit test is required because a categorical variable (preference) with three levels is recorded, a single group/population was recorded, and the observed frequencies are being compared to a theoretical distribution in the null hypothesis. The data appear to be part of an observational study where the individuals were randomly selected. The expected frequencies are equal to the total number of observations times the expected proportions, which is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), for each level (this is the same as dividing the total number of observations by three for each level; Table 21.3). The test statistic below should follow a 2 distribution because there is more than five individuals expected in each of the three levels.

"],["RData.html", "Module 22 Getting Data into R 22.1 R Notebooks 22.2 Data in R 22.3 Viewing a Data Frame 22.4 Vectors", " Module 22 Getting Data into R R, RStudio, the NCStats package, and very basic usage of R were introduced here. This module explains how to enter data into R. Subsequent modules will explain how to use R to create the graphics and compute statistics and test results from these data. 22.1 R Notebooks Notebooks in RStudio are an efficient way to enter R code, show results of R code, write answers to assignment questions, and compile all of that to a docment that can be handed in. For class assignments, start by downloading this template (right-click, dont change the name) to a folder where you plan to store all of your class-related work. Then open the template in RStudio and change the Author in line 3 to your name. Save the template with this change. Every time you start an assignment you should open the template file in RStudio and immediately save it (File .. Save As) with a different name (e.g., Assignment1  make sure that the name does not have a dot in it). Then edit the Title in line 2 to something that represents the assignment (e.g., Linear Regression in R). Do not change anything else in the first 21 lines. 22.1.1 Including Text in the Notebook Creating Sections Most assignments will have several questions, each of which is identified with a section heading. Your answers to the assignments should be shown under section headings with the same name as on the assignment. Section headings are created by preceding the section heading name with a hashtag. The template has several section headings started that look like this  # EDIT THIS WITH FIRST SECTION HEADING TEXT You should change this text to create the section heading that you want; e.g., # Arctic Penguins Writing Text for Your Answers Sentences can be included by typing the text at the beginning of any line. A new paragraph is created by pressing return twice so that there is a blank line between paragraphs. Numbered Lists for Your Answers A numbered list is created by starting a line with 1.76 followed by what you want after the number (e.g., your answer). If there are no blank lines between consecutive 1. items then RStudio will automatically iterate the number when the document is compiled. For example, typing this   produces the text below  A univariate EDA for penguin body mass is Shape  right-skewed Outlier  None Center  Median of 4050 g Dispersion  IQR from Q1 of 3550 g to Q3 of 4750 g. Why?  I used the median and IQR because of the skewed shape of the data. Including R Code and Results Any R code that you use to answer questions should be included in a subsection of R code and results AFTER you have answered the questions. You can create a subsection for this code by starting a line with #### R Code and Results. All R code is entered into code chunks that begin with three backticks followed by curly brackets around r (see line 33 below) and end with three backticks (see line 36 below). Between the beginning and ending of the code chunk can be any viable R code. For example, In RStudio, each code chunk will have three icons in the upper-right portion of the gray chunk (see above). Pressing the right-most icon (right-pointing green arrow) will run the code in the current chunk and show the results immediately below the chunk. For example, If the code in this chunk depends on code in previous chunks being run then press the middle icon (gray down arrow pointing to a green horizontal line) to run all code in chunks above the current chunk. If the code in previous chunks had already been run then this is unnecessary. Vertical Spacing If you would like to add some vertical spacing between parts of your notebook (e.g., between sections, between code and paragraphs, etc.) then add a br between less than and greater than signs (see below) with a blank line both above and below it where you want the vertical spacing. For example, Code Chunk Custom Settings Code chunks can have a variety of settings. The most important settings can be controlled through the left-most gear icon. My most common change here is to change the figure width to be smaller (to 4 inches wide) and, if you want the plot to be square, to change the figure height to the same value. I may also turn off the warnings and messages, but I never do this immediately as I would like to see those first before deciding that I should hide them. Below shows the gear box for changing the figure width and how the code chunk and result is changed. 22.1.2 Compile Notebook to MSWord Once you are comfortable that your R code runs without error and that you have answered all questions for the assignment, then compile your Notebook to a MSWord document. In MSWord you can then save the document to a PDF for handing in via GradeScope. Check your document for completeness and neatness before turning in. To compile the Notebook to MSWord, select the small arrow on the icon that either says Preview or Knit and select Knit to Word. If you get an error related to the name of your Notebook file, then simply select Knit to Word a second time. If the document does not produce an MSWord document (this make take several seconds) then there may be an error in your R code. 22.2 Data in R 22.2.1 Create CSV File For real data (i.e., several variables from many individuals) it is most efficient to enter data into a comma-separated values (CSV) file and then import that file into R. Creating a CSV file with Microsoft Excel is described below, though there are other ways to create CSV files (see FAQs on class webpage). This explanation assumes that you have a basic understanding of Excel (or other spreadsheet software). The spreadsheet should be organized with variables in columns and individuals in rows, with the exception that the first row should contain variable names. The example spreadsheet below shows the length (cm), weight (kg), and capture location data for a small sample of Black Bears. Variable names should NOT contain spaces. For example, dont use total length or length (cm). If you feel the need to have longer variable names, then separate the parts with a period (e.g., length.cm) or an underscore (e.g., length_cm). Furthermore, numerical measurements should NOT include units (e.g., dont use 7 cm). Finally, for categorical data, make sure that all categories are consistent (e.g., do not have a column that contains both bayfield and Bayfield). The spreadsheet is saved as a CSV file by selecting the File..Save As menu item, which will produce the dialog box below. In this dialog box, change Save as type to CSV (Comma delimited),77, provide a file name (do not put any periods in the name), select a location to save the file (this should be the same location as your assignment template file), and press Save. Two warning dialog boxes may then appear  select OK for the first and YES for the second. You can now close the spreadsheet file.78 It is important that each row of the data frame correspond to one individual. This is critically important when data are recorded for two different groups (e.g., for a two-sample t-test; see Module 24). For example, the following data are methyl mercury levels recorded in mussels from two locations labeled as impacted and reference. impacted 0.011 0.054 0.056 0.095 0.051 0.077 reference 0.031 0.040 0.029 0.066 0.018 0.042 0.044 To follow the one individual per row rule, these data are entered in stacked format where the reference data are stacked underneath the impacted data and a column is used to indicate to which group the individuals belong. For example, the Excel file for data entry would look like the following. Some of the data files that you will use are linked to on the pertinent assignment page (e.g., this link). In these cases, the data should be downloaded with the link (right-click, save as) and saved in the same directory or folder as your analysis notebook. The downloaded file is then read into R in the same manner as described above. Note that files provided by me will already be in stacked format and will already be a CSV file. 22.2.2 Read CSV File into RStudio Use read.csv() in the first R code chunk of your assignment notebook to load the data from the CSV file into RStudio. The EXACT name of the data file is including within quotes within read.csv() and the results should be saved to an object. For example, the code highlighted in yellow in the graphic below was used to read the external Bears.csv file into an R object called dat. The circled items in the lower-right pane demonstrate that the Bears.csv file is in the same directory as the assignment notebooks file. One should check the data in this object as described in the Viewing a Data Frame section below. 22.3 Viewing a Data Frame R may be disorienting at first because you generally cannot see your data in the same way that you see it in a spreadsheet program. There are, however, several options for viewing your data. First, you can type the name of the data frame object to see its entire contents. bears #R&gt; length.cm weight.kg loc #R&gt; 1 139.0 110 Bayfield #R&gt; 2 138.0 60 Bayfield #R&gt; 3 139.0 90 Bayfield #R&gt; 4 120.5 60 Bayfield #R&gt; 5 149.0 85 Bayfield #R&gt; 6 141.0 100 Ashland #R&gt; 7 141.0 95 Ashland #R&gt; 8 150.0 85 Douglas #R&gt; 9 166.0 155 Douglas #R&gt; 10 151.5 140 Douglas #R&gt; 11 129.5 105 Douglas #R&gt; 12 150.0 110 Douglas Typing the name is adequate for small data.frames, but not useful for large data.frames. The entire data.frame is opened in a separate window by double-clicking on the name of the data.frame in the Environment tab of RStudio. Alternatively, you can view a subset of 20 rows of a data frame with peek(), the first six rows with head(), the last six rows with tail(), or the first and last three rows with headtail(). peek(bears) #R&gt; length.cm weight.kg loc #R&gt; 1 139.0 110 Bayfield #R&gt; 2 138.0 60 Bayfield #R&gt; 3 139.0 90 Bayfield #R&gt; 4 120.5 60 Bayfield #R&gt; 5 149.0 85 Bayfield #R&gt; 6 141.0 100 Ashland #R&gt; 7 141.0 95 Ashland #R&gt; 8 150.0 85 Douglas #R&gt; 9 166.0 155 Douglas #R&gt; 10 151.5 140 Douglas #R&gt; 11 129.5 105 Douglas #R&gt; 12 150.0 110 Douglas head(bears) #R&gt; length.cm weight.kg loc #R&gt; 1 139.0 110 Bayfield #R&gt; 2 138.0 60 Bayfield #R&gt; 3 139.0 90 Bayfield #R&gt; 4 120.5 60 Bayfield #R&gt; 5 149.0 85 Bayfield #R&gt; 6 141.0 100 Ashland tail(bears) #R&gt; length.cm weight.kg loc #R&gt; 7 141.0 95 Ashland #R&gt; 8 150.0 85 Douglas #R&gt; 9 166.0 155 Douglas #R&gt; 10 151.5 140 Douglas #R&gt; 11 129.5 105 Douglas #R&gt; 12 150.0 110 Douglas headtail(bears) #R&gt; length.cm weight.kg loc #R&gt; 1 139.0 110 Bayfield #R&gt; 2 138.0 60 Bayfield #R&gt; 3 139.0 90 Bayfield #R&gt; 10 151.5 140 Douglas #R&gt; 11 129.5 105 Douglas #R&gt; 12 150.0 110 Douglas 22.3.1 Structure and Data Types Data in R will be designated as an integer (whole numbers), numeric (non-integer numeric values), character (strings), factor (group membership), or logical (TRUE/FALSE). Integer and numeric data types correspond to quantitative data. Character and factor data types correspond to categorical data, with the factor data type having special characteristics in R that we will exploit for certain analyses. These types of data will be discussed further as needed in other modules. In addition to viewing the contents of a data object, it is useful to examine the structure of the data frame as returned from str(). str(bears) #R&gt; &#39;data.frame&#39;: 12 obs. of 3 variables: #R&gt; $ length.cm: num 139 138 139 120 149 ... #R&gt; $ weight.kg: int 110 60 90 60 85 100 95 85 155 140 ... #R&gt; $ loc : chr &quot;Bayfield&quot; &quot;Bayfield&quot; &quot;Bayfield&quot; &quot;Bayfield&quot; ... In this example, it is seen that three variables were recorded on 12 individuals. The first variables  length.cm  is numeric, the second  weight.kg  is integer, and the last  loc  is a character variable. The unique values in a character variable may be seen with unique(). unique(bears$loc) #R&gt; [1] &quot;Bayfield&quot; &quot;Ashland&quot; &quot;Douglas&quot; A character variable may be converted to a factor variable with factor(). In this course, the main reason for doing this would be to control the levels of an ordinal variable because R treats levels alphabetically by default. For example suppose that we wanted to order the levels of the loc variable from west to east (so, Douglas, Bayfield, and Ashland). For this purpose the variable is converted to a factor below with factor() and the order of the levels is controlled with levels=. Make sure the levels are spelled EXACTLY as they appear in the data. bears$loc &lt;- factor(bears$loc,levels=c(&quot;Douglas&quot;,&quot;Bayfield&quot;,&quot;Ashland&quot;)) levels(bears$loc) #R&gt; [1] &quot;Douglas&quot; &quot;Bayfield&quot; &quot;Ashland&quot; The levels of a factor variable and their order may be seen with levels(). levels(bears$loc) #R&gt; [1] &quot;Douglas&quot; &quot;Bayfield&quot; &quot;Ashland&quot; In the previous examples, the $ notation was used to identify a particular variable (i.e., loc) within a data.frame (bears). Think of variables as being nested inside data.frames and, thus, to access the variable you must first identify the data.frame in which it exists and then the name of the variable. The $ simply separates the data.frame from the variable. bears$length.cm #R&gt; [1] 139.0 138.0 139.0 120.5 149.0 141.0 141.0 150.0 166.0 151.5 129.5 150.0 bears$loc #R&gt; [1] Bayfield Bayfield Bayfield Bayfield Bayfield Ashland Ashland Douglas #R&gt; [9] Douglas Douglas Douglas Douglas #R&gt; Levels: Douglas Bayfield Ashland 22.4 Vectors Data.frames are the primary structure in which to store real data. However, much simpler situations that dont require a data.frame may arise. In R, items of the same data type (see [Data Types]) are stored in a one-dimensional vector. Vectors are usually displayed in one row (with many columns), but they may also be thought of as a single column (with many rows). Items are entered into a vector with c(), where the individual arguments are specific numbers, characters, or logical values.79 Items for a vector of characters must be contained within paired quotes. ( v &lt;- c(1,2,5) ) #R&gt; [1] 1 2 5 ( y &lt;- c(&quot;Iowa&quot;,&quot;Minnesota&quot;,&quot;Wisconsin&quot;) ) #R&gt; [1] &quot;Iowa&quot; &quot;Minnesota&quot; &quot;Wisconsin&quot; Single variables from a data.frame are vectors. bears$length.cm #R&gt; [1] 139.0 138.0 139.0 120.5 149.0 141.0 141.0 150.0 166.0 151.5 129.5 150.0 Vectors that are not extracted from a data.frame will only be used in this course for very simple lists of items, usually as arguments in a function. Note the space after the dot and before the text that will form the list item. There are several choices for CSV files here; do NOT choose the one with UTF-8 in the name. You may be asked to save changes  you should say No. c comes from concatenate or combine.

In this module, we will learn how to create subsets (i.e., filter) of a data frame into smaller data frames. For example, you may want to create a data frame that contains just male bears from a data frame with both male and female bears, or a data frame that contains only sales during summer months from a data frame that contains all sales. Less often you may wish to eliminate a particular individual from the data frame, perhaps if it is considered to be erroneous. This module also uses the bears data frame from Module 22, which is shown below for reference. library(NCStats) bears &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Bears.csv&quot;) bears #R&gt; length.cm weight.kg loc #R&gt; 1 139.0 110 Bayfield #R&gt; 2 138.0 60 Bayfield #R&gt; 3 139.0 90 Bayfield #R&gt; 4 120.5 60 Bayfield #R&gt; 5 149.0 85 Bayfield #R&gt; 6 141.0 100 Ashland #R&gt; 7 141.0 95 Ashland #R&gt; 8 150.0 85 Douglas #R&gt; 9 166.0 155 Douglas #R&gt; 10 151.5 140 Douglas #R&gt; 11 129.5 105 Douglas #R&gt; 12 150.0 110 Douglas 23.1 Filtering a data frame It is common to create a new data frame that contains only some of the individuals from an existing data frame. The process of creating the newer, smaller data frame is called filtering (or subsetting) and is accomplished with filterD().80 The filterD() function requires the original data frame as the first argument and a condition statement as the second argument. The condition statement is used to either include or exclude individuals from the original data frame. Condition statements consist of the name of a variable in the original data frame, a comparison operator, and a comparison value (Table 23.1). The results from filterD() should be assigned to an object, which is then the name of the new data frame. filterD() is used to create a subset of a data frame. Table 23.1: Comparison operators used in filterD() and their results. Note that var generically represents a variable in the original data frame and value is a generic value or level. Both var and val would be replaced with specific items (see examples in main text). Comparison Operator Rows Returned from Original Data Frame var==value All rows where var IS equal to value var!=value All rows where var is NOT equal to value var %in% c(value1,value2) All rows where var IS IN vector of values81 var&amp;gt;value All rows where var is greater than value82 var&amp;gt;=value All rows where var is greater than or equal to value83 var&amp;lt;value All rows where var is less than value84 var&amp;lt;=value All rows where var is less than or equal to value85 condition1,condition2 All rows where BOTH conditions are true condition1 | condition2 All rows where ONE or BOTH conditions are true86 The following are examples of new data frames created from bears. The name of the new data frame (i.e., object left of the assignment operator) can be any valid object name. As demonstrated below, the new data frame should be examined after each filtering to ensure that the data frame actually contains the items that you desire.87 Examine the new data frame after subsetting to ensure that it contains the data you intended.

Positions within an object are identified within square brackets. As data frames are two-dimensional objects they are indexed by a row and a column, in that order. For example, the item in the third row and second column of bears is selected below. bears[3,2] #R&gt; [1] 90 An entire row or column may be selected by omitting the other dimension. For example, one could select the entire second column with bears[,2], but this is also the weight.kg variable and is better selected with bears$weight.kg. As a better example, the entire third row is selected below (note that the column designation was omitted). bears[3,] #R&gt; length.cm weight.kg loc #R&gt; 3 139 90 Bayfield Multiple rows are selected by combining row indices together with c(). For example, the third, fifth, and eighth rows are selected below (again, the column index is omitted). bears[c(3,5,8),] #R&gt; length.cm weight.kg loc #R&gt; 3 139 90 Bayfield #R&gt; 5 149 85 Bayfield #R&gt; 8 150 85 Douglas Finally, rows can be excluded by preceding the row indices with a negative sign. bears[-c(3,5,8,10,12),] #R&gt; length.cm weight.kg loc #R&gt; 1 139.0 110 Bayfield #R&gt; 2 138.0 60 Bayfield #R&gt; 4 120.5 60 Bayfield #R&gt; 6 141.0 100 Ashland #R&gt; 7 141.0 95 Ashland #R&gt; 9 166.0 155 Douglas #R&gt; 11 129.5 105 Douglas filterD() requires the NCStats package. value should be a character, factor, or integer. value must be numeric. value must be numeric. value must be numeric. value must be numeric.

GSS &lt;- read.csv(&quot;GSSEnviroQues.csv&quot;) head(GSS) #R&gt; recycle tempgen #R&gt; 1 Always Extremely #R&gt; 2 Always Extremely #R&gt; 3 Always Extremely #R&gt; 4 Always Extremely #R&gt; 5 Always Extremely #R&gt; 6 Always Extremely 24.1 Quantitative 24.1.1 Summary Statistics The main summary statistics for quantitative data are the mean, median, standard deviation, IQR, and range, as described in Module 5. These statistics can be computed in R with Summarize(),89 using a one-sided formula of the form ~qvar, where qvar generically represents the quantitative variable. The data frame that contains qvar is included in data=. The number of digits after the decimal place may be controlled with digits=. Summarize(~days,data=LSI,digits=1) #R&gt; n nvalid mean sd min Q1 median Q3 max #R&gt; 42.0 39.0 107.8 21.6 48.0 97.0 114.0 118.0 146.0 From this it is seen that the sample median is 114 days, sample mean is 107.8 days, sample IQR is from 97 to 118 days, the sample standard deviation is 21.6 days, and the range is from 48 to 146 days. Also note that the overall sample size is 42, though three individuals must have been missing as the valid n is only 39. Use Summarize() to compute summary statistics for a quantitative variable. Remember the tilde (~) when using Summarize(). 24.1.2 Histograms All graphs made with ggplot2 begin with ggplot() using a data= argument that defines the data frame to be used for the graphic. Variables for the x- and y-axes are then declared within aes() as the second argument. A histogram requires only the variable for the x-axis. To this base information, geom_histogram() is added to produce a simple default histogram. ggplot(data=LSI,aes(x=days)) + geom_histogram() Only define the x variable for a histogram. This base histogram is rather ugly. Fortunately it can be improved fairly easily. Most importantly, set bins= to the desired number of bins.90 Additionally, the bin bars can be made more readable by outlining them in black with color=\"black\" and filling then with a light gray with fill=\"lightgray\". ggplot(data=LSI,aes(x=days)) + geom_histogram(bins=10,color=&quot;black&quot;,fill=&quot;lightgray&quot;) While this histogram is great improved it will look better if the bars are set on the x-axis with scale_y_continuous() shown below,91 the x- and y-axes are labeled more appropriately using x= and y= in labs() as shown below, and we use theme_NCStats(),92 which was created especially for this class. ggplot(data=LSI,aes(x=days)) + geom_histogram(bins=10,color=&quot;black&quot;,fill=&quot;lightgray&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.05))) + labs(x=&quot;Number of Days of Ice Cover&quot;,y=&quot;Frequency of Years&quot;) + theme_NCStats() When making your own histogram, copy the code above and change data=, x=, bins=, x=, and y=. 24.2 Quantitative for Multiple Groups It is common to need to compute numerical or construct graphical summaries of a quantitative variable separately for groups of individuals. In these cases it is beneficial to have a function that will efficiently compute summary statistics and construct a histogram for the quantitative variable separated by the levels of a factor variable. As an example, the LSI data.frame contains a period variable that indicates whether the ice season was pre-1975 or post-1975 (which included 1975). Thus, one may be interested in examining the distribution of annual days of ice for each of these periods. As period is a categorical variable it is first converted to a factor data type, with the levels controlled to their proper order. LSI$period &lt;- factor(LSI$period,levels=c(&quot;pre-1975&quot;,&quot;post-1975&quot;)) str(LSI) #R&gt; &#39;data.frame&#39;: 42 obs. of 5 variables: #R&gt; $ season: int 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 ... #R&gt; $ decade: int 1950 1950 1950 1950 1950 1960 1960 1960 1960 1960 ... #R&gt; $ period: Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;pre-1975&quot;,&quot;post-1975&quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... #R&gt; $ temp : num 22.9 23 25.7 20 24.8 ... #R&gt; $ days : int 87 137 106 97 105 118 118 136 91 NA ... 24.2.1 Summary Statistics Summary statistics are separated by group by giving Summarize() a formula of the form qvar~cvar, where cvar generically represents the factor variable that indicates to which group the individuals belong. Summarize(days~period,data=LSI,digits=1) #R&gt; period n nvalid mean sd min Q1 median Q3 max #R&gt; 1 pre-1975 20 18 109.1 15.6 82 97 110.5 118 137 #R&gt; 2 post-1975 22 21 106.8 26.0 48 99 116.0 123 146 24.2.2 Histograms A histogram can be separated by levels in the cvar variable by adding facet_wrap() with ~cvar as its only argument to the general histogram code (as shown above). ggplot(data=LSI,aes(x=days)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=15,boundary=0,color=&quot;black&quot;,fill=&quot;lightgray&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.05))) + labs(x=&quot;Number of Days of Ice Cover&quot;,y=&quot;Frequency of Years&quot;) + theme_NCStats() + facet_wrap(~period) 24.2.3 Boxplots Side-by-side modern boxplots can be constructed by first declaring the quantitative variable as y= and the grouping variable as x= in aes() in ggplot() and then adding geom_boxplot(). As shown below, the boxplots may be outlined and filled, proper labels should be added, and course them should be added. ggplot(data=LSI,aes(x=period,y=days)) + geom_boxplot(color=&quot;black&quot;,fill=&quot;lightgray&quot;) + labs(x=&quot;Period&quot;,y=&quot;Number of Days of Ice Cover&quot;) + theme_NCStats() Must declare both x= and y= for a boxplot. 24.3 Categorical Data 24.3.1 Data Manipulation Methods for summarizing categorical data work best if the categorical variable is recorded as a factor variable in R (data types discussed in Section 22.3.1. Most often the variable will need to be coerced into being a factor variable. For example, the recycle variable in GSS is a character variable by default. str(GSS) #R&gt; &#39;data.frame&#39;: 3539 obs. of 2 variables: #R&gt; $ recycle: chr &quot;Always&quot; &quot;Always&quot; &quot;Always&quot; &quot;Always&quot; ... #R&gt; $ tempgen: chr &quot;Extremely&quot; &quot;Extremely&quot; &quot;Extremely&quot; &quot;Extremely&quot; ... Categorical data can be forced to be a factor data type with factor(). The order of the levels, most importantly for ordinal data, can be controlled by including the ordered level names within a vector given to levels= in factor(). For example, the recycle variable in GSS is forced to be a factor below and its levels are controlled to follow their natural order. GSS$recycle &lt;- factor(GSS$recycle, levels=c(&quot;Always&quot;,&quot;Often&quot;,&quot;Sometimes&quot;,&quot;Never&quot;,&quot;Not Avail&quot;)) str(GSS) #R&gt; &#39;data.frame&#39;: 3539 obs. of 2 variables: #R&gt; $ recycle: Factor w/ 5 levels &quot;Always&quot;,&quot;Often&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... #R&gt; $ tempgen: chr &quot;Extremely&quot; &quot;Extremely&quot; &quot;Extremely&quot; &quot;Extremely&quot; ... levels(GSS$recycle) #R&gt; [1] &quot;Always&quot; &quot;Often&quot; &quot;Sometimes&quot; &quot;Never&quot; &quot;Not Avail&quot; The names of the levels in the vector given to levels= must be exactly as they appear in the original variable and they must be contained within quotes. Prior to using factor(), include the variable in unique() to see what the names of the levels are. unique(GSS$recycle) #R&gt; [1] &quot;Always&quot; &quot;Often&quot; &quot;Sometimes&quot; &quot;Never&quot; &quot;Not Avail&quot; Convert categorical data to a factor variable before summarizing. Use factor() to convert categorical data to a factor variable. Check the spelling of levels when changing their order. 24.3.2 Frequency and Percentage Tables A frequency table of a single categorical variable is computed with xtabs(), where the first argument is a one-sided formula of the form ~cvar and the corresponding data frame is in data=. The result from xtabs() should be assigned to an object for further use. For example, the frequency table is produced, stored in tabRecycle, and displayed below. ( tabRecycle &lt;- xtabs(~recycle,data=GSS) ) #R&gt; recycle #R&gt; Always Often Sometimes Never Not Avail #R&gt; 1289 850 823 448 129 A percentage table is computed by including the saved frequency table as the first argument to percTable().93 The number of digits of output is controlled with digits=, though this defaults to 1 which is adequate for most percentages. percTable(tabRecycle) #R&gt; recycle #R&gt; Always Often Sometimes Never Not Avail #R&gt; 36.4 24.0 23.3 12.7 3.6 24.3.3 Bar Charts A bar chart is constructed by declaring only the categorical variable as x= within aes() of ggplot() and then adding geom_bar(). As shown below, the outline and fill colors of the bars may be set, the bars should be set on the x-axis as with the histograms, the axes should be properly labeled, and the course theme should be used. ggplot(data=GSS,aes(x=recycle)) + geom_bar(color=&quot;black&quot;,fill=&quot;lightgray&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.05))) + labs(x=&quot;Respondent&#39;s Response&quot;,y=&quot;Frequency of Respondents&quot;) + theme_NCStats() When making your own bar chart, copy the code above and change data=, x=, and y=. Data originally from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Summarize() is from NCStats. Generally near 8-10 bins, depending on n. A full description of this code is beyond this class, but this exact code should be used for all histograms constructed for this class. This theme mostly removes the background grid and color. Thus, xtabs() must be completed and saved to an object before percTable(). "],["RBivEDA.html", "Module 25 Bivariate EDA in R 25.1 Quantitative 25.2 Categorical", " Module 25 Bivariate EDA in R In the Modules 8 and 10 you practiced performing an EDA for pairs of quantitative or categorical data using summary statistics and graphics. In this module, you will learn how to construct those summary statistics and graphics from data using R. You will also be asked to perform the EDA from these results. Methods in this module require the NCStats package (as always) and the ggplot2 package (for making graphs). library(NCStats) library(ggplot2) Data Sets The quantitative summaries and graphics will use the weight (lbs) and highway miles per gallon (HMPG) for 93 cars from the 1993 model year.

What is your highest degree earned? [choices  less than high school diploma, high school diploma, junior college, bachelors, or graduate; labeled as degree] How willing would you be to accept cuts in your standard of living in order to protect the environment? [choices  very willing, fairly willing, neither willing nor unwilling, not very willing, or not at all willing; labeled as grnsol] These data, stored in GSSWill2Pay.csv (data,meta), are loaded into R and examined below. gss &lt;- read.csv(&quot;GSSWill2Pay.csv&quot;) str(gss) #R&gt; &#39;data.frame&#39;: 3955 obs. of 2 variables: #R&gt; $ degree: chr &quot;ltHS&quot; &quot;ltHS&quot; &quot;ltHS&quot; &quot;ltHS&quot; ... #R&gt; $ grnsol: chr &quot;vwill&quot; &quot;vwill&quot; &quot;vwill&quot; &quot;vwill&quot; ... As is typical, the categorical variables are recorded as character type. Both degree and grnsol are ordinal categorical variables and, thus, should be converted to factor variables types so that the order of the levels can be controlled. To assist with this, use unique() to see the exact spelling of each of the levels. unique(gss$degree) #R&gt; [1] &quot;ltHS&quot; &quot;HS&quot; &quot;JC&quot; &quot;BS&quot; &quot;grad&quot; unique(gss$grnsol) #R&gt; [1] &quot;vwill&quot; &quot;will&quot; &quot;neither&quot; &quot;un&quot; &quot;vun&quot; The variables are then converted to factors below with factor() using levels= to control the order of the variables.95 gss$degree &lt;- factor(gss$degree,levels=c(&quot;ltHS&quot;,&quot;HS&quot;,&quot;JC&quot;,&quot;BS&quot;,&quot;grad&quot;)) gss$grnsol &lt;- factor(gss$grnsol,levels=c(&quot;vwill&quot;,&quot;will&quot;,&quot;neither&quot;,&quot;un&quot;,&quot;vun&quot;)) The levels are checked with levels() below to make sure that the order is correct and that none are missing (which would imply that the level was mis-spelled above). levels(gss$degree) #R&gt; [1] &quot;ltHS&quot; &quot;HS&quot; &quot;JC&quot; &quot;BS&quot; &quot;grad&quot; levels(gss$grnsol) #R&gt; [1] &quot;vwill&quot; &quot;will&quot; &quot;neither&quot; &quot;un&quot; &quot;vun&quot; Ordinal variables should be converted to factor variables in R. Levels should be controlled for ordinal variables. 25.1 Quantitative 25.1.1 Scatterplots Scatterplots are constructed by giving the x- and y-axis variables to x= and y= in aes() in ggplot()96 and then adding geom_point(). ggplot(data=cars93,aes(x=Weight,y=HMPG)) + geom_point() Define both x and y variables for a scatterplot. The axis labels can be properly labeled with labs() and the theme used in the course applied with theme_NCStats().97 ggplot(data=cars93,aes(x=Weight,y=HMPG)) + geom_point() + labs(x=&quot;Car Weight (lbs)&quot;,y=&quot;Miles per Gallon on the Highway&quot;) + theme_NCStats() There may be times where you want to change the shape of symbol that is plotted by including a numeric code to shape= in geom_point(). Shape codes are shown in Figure 25.1. Figure 25.1: Point shapes available in R and their numerical codes. For shapes 0-20 that color= controls the shapes color, but for shapes 21-25 color= controls the outline color and fill controls the inside color of the shape. My typical choice for plotting points are shown below.98 ggplot(data=cars93,aes(x=Weight,y=HMPG)) + geom_point(shape=21,color=&quot;black&quot;,fill=&quot;darkgray&quot;,size=2) + labs(x=&quot;Car Weight (lbs)&quot;,y=&quot;Miles per Gallon on the Highway&quot;) + theme_NCStats() When making your own scatterplot, copy the code above and change data=, x=, y=. 25.1.2 Correlation Coefficient The correlation coefficient (\\(r\\)) between two quantitative variables is computed with corr() using a formula of the form qvarY~qvarX or ~qvarY+qvarX, where qvarY and qvarX are the names of quantitative variables, as the first argument and the corresponding data frame in data=.99 For example, the correlation coefficient between highway MPG and weight for all cars in the car data is -0.81. corr(HMPG~Weight,data=cars93) #R&gt; [1] -0.8106581 corr(~HMPG+Weight,data=cars93) # alternative form #R&gt; [1] -0.8106581 The correlation coefficients can be computed for pairs of multiple variables using the alternative formula described above. Note that use=\"pairwise.complete.obs\" is used to make sure that missing data is removed when calculating the correlation coefficient for each pair of variables. corr(~HMPG+FuelTank+Length+Weight,data=cars93,use=&quot;pairwise.complete.obs&quot;,digits=2) #R&gt; HMPG FuelTank Length Weight #R&gt; HMPG 1.00 -0.79 -0.54 -0.81 #R&gt; FuelTank -0.79 1.00 0.69 0.89 #R&gt; Length -0.54 0.69 1.00 0.81 #R&gt; Weight -0.81 0.89 0.81 1.00 25.2 Categorical 25.2.1 Frequency Tables Two-way frequency tables are constructed in R with xtabs(), where the first argument is a formula of the form ~cvarRow+cvarCol, where cvarRow and cvarCol are categorical variables to form the rows and columns of the table, in the first agument and the corresponding data frame in data=. The result of xtabs() should be assigned to an object for further use.

The geom_smooth() function requires method=\"lm\" to show the linear regression line and se=FALSE to remove the underlying confidence band.102 ggplot(data=cars93,mapping=aes(x=Weight,y=HMPG)) + geom_point(pch=21,color=&quot;black&quot;,fill=&quot;darkgray&quot;,size=2) + labs(x=&quot;Weight (lbs)&quot;,y=&quot;Highway MPG&quot;) + theme_NCStats() + geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;,se=FALSE) Use method=\"lm\" in geom_smooth() to add the regression line to an existing scatterplot. 26.2 Fitting the Regression Model in R The linear regression model is fit to two quantitative variables with lm(). The first argument is a formula of the form response~explanatory, where response contains the quantitative response variable and explanatory contains the quantitative explanatory variable. The corresponding data frame is given in data=. The results of lm() may be assigned to an object so that specific results can be extracted. ( lm1 &lt;- lm(HMPG~Weight,data=cars93) ) #R&gt; Coefficients: #R&gt; (Intercept) Weight #R&gt; 51.601365 -0.007327 The regression results above show that the intercept is 51.6 and the slope is -0.0073. The slope is under the name of the explanatory variable and the intercept is under (Intercept) in the lm() results. 26.3 Coefficient of Determination The coefficient of determination is computed by submitting the saved lm() object to rSquared(). For example, 65.7% of the variability in highway MPG for a car is explained by knowing its weight. [Note the use of digits= to control the number of decimals.] rSquared(lm1,digits=3) #R&gt; [1] 0.657 26.4 Predicted Values Predicted values from the linear regression are obtained with predict(), which requires the saved lm() object as its first argument. The second argument is a data frame constructed with data.frame() that contains the EXACT name of the explanatory variable as it appeared in lm() set equal to the value of the explanatory at which the prediction should be made. For example, the predicted highway MPG for a car that weights 2500 lbs is 33.3, as obtained below. predict(lm1,data.frame(Weight=2500)) #R&gt; 1 #R&gt; 33.28372 The which= argument in headtail() is used to show only a few variables of cars93, just to save space.

H0:  = 24.3oC vs. HA:   24.3oC, where  is the mean body temperature of ALL crabs. A 1-Sample t-Test is required because  a quantitative variable (temperature) was measured, individuals from one group (or population) were considered (an ill-defined population of crabs), and  is UNknown. The data appear to be part of an experimental study (the temperature was controlled) with no suggestion of random selection of individuals. The assumptions are met because n = 25  15 and the sample distribution of crab temperatures appears to be only slightly right-skewed (Figure 27.1) and  is UNknown. x = 25.0oC (Table 27.1). t = 2.713 with 24 df (Table 27.1). p-value = 0.0121 (Table 27.1). Reject H0 because the p-value &lt; . It appears that the average body temperature of ALL crabs is greater than the ambient temperature of 24.3oC. I am 95% confident that the mean body temperature of ALL crabs is between 24.5oC and 25.6oC (Table 27.1).

In this module, you will learn how to perform the required calculations from raw data using R. You will also be asked to complete the full 11-steps for a 2-sample t-test. 27.2.1 Data Format The data used in this reading are the biological oxygen demand (BOD) measurements from either the inlet or outlet to an aquaculture facility. These data are in BOD.csv (data, meta) and loaded into R below. aqua &lt;- read.csv(&quot;BOD.csv&quot;) str(aqua) Data must be in stacked format (as described in Section 22.2.1) for a 2-Sample t-Test. Stacked data has measurements in one column and group labels for the measurement in another column. Thus, each row corresponds to a measurement and the group for one individual. The BOD data are stacked because each row corresponds to one individual (a water sample) with one column of (BOD) measurements and another column for which group the individual belongs. headtail(aqua) #R&gt; BOD src #R&gt; 1 6.782 inlet #R&gt; 2 5.809 inlet #R&gt; 3 6.849 inlet #R&gt; 18 8.545 outlet #R&gt; 19 8.063 outlet #R&gt; 20 8.001 outlet 27.2.2 Levenes Test Before conducting a 2-Sample t-Test, the assumption of equal population variances must be tested with Levenes test. The Levenes test is computed with levenesTest(), where the first argument is a formula of the form qvar~cvar, where qvar represents the quantitative response variable and cvar represents the group factor variable.103 The data.frame containing qvar and cvar is given in data=. The results of the following code are shown in Table 27.2 and interpreted in the example analysis below. levenesTest(BOD~src,data=aqua) 27.2.3 Histograms If the combined sample size for the two groups is less than 40 than histograms for both groups must be made to address the assumptions of normality before continuing with a 2-sample t-test. Separating histograms by groups was discussed in Section 24.2.1. The results of the following code are shown in Figure 27.2 and interpreted in the example analysis below. ggplot(data=aqua,aes(x=BOD)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=0.5,boundary=0,color=&quot;black&quot;,fill=&quot;lightgray&quot;) + scale_y_continuous(expand=expansion(mult=c(0,0.05))) + labs(x=&quot;Biological Oxygen Demand&quot;,y=&quot;Frequency of Sites&quot;) + theme_NCStats() + facet_wrap(vars(src)) 27.2.4 2-Sample t-Test in R A 2-Sample t-Test is computed with t.test(), where the first argument is the same formula as in levenesTest() (and, thus, same data=). Additionally, the following arguments may need to be specified. mu=: The specific value in H0. For a 2-Sample t-Test this is usually 0, which is the default. alt=: A string that indicates the type of HA (i.e., \"two.sided\" (default), \"greater\", or \"less\"). conf.level=: The level of confidence (default is 0.95) used for the confidence region of 1-2. var.equal=: A logical value that indicates whether the two population variances should be considered equal or not. If TRUE, then the pooled sample variance is calculated and used in the standard error. The default FALSE, to assume UNequal variances. R computes the difference among groups as the alphabetically first level minus the alphabetically second level. For example, if the two levels are inlet and outlet, then R will compute xinlet-xoutlet. You should consider this when you are constructing your hypotheses. However, you can change the order of the levels by using levels= in factor() (as described in Section 24.3.1). The results of the following code are shown in Table 27.3 and interpreted in the example analysis below. t.test(BOD~src,data=aqua,var.equal=TRUE,alt=&quot;less&quot;,conf.level=0.90) 27.2.5 Example - BOD in Aquaculture Water Below are the 11 steps of a hypothesis test (Section 17.1) for the following situation (which follows from above): An aquaculture farm takes water from a stream and returns it to the stream after it has circulated through the fish tanks. The owner has taken steps to reduce the level of organic matter in the water released back into the stream. However, he is still concerned that water returned to the stream may contain heightened levels of organic matter. To determine if this is true, he took samples of water at the intake and, at other times, downstream from the outlet and recorded the biological oxygen demand (BOD) as a measure of the organics in the effluent (a higher BOD at the outlet would imply heightened levels of organics are being released to the stream). The owners data are recorded in BOD.csv. Test for any evidence (i.e., at the 10% level) to support the owners concern.  = 0.10. H0:inlet-outlet=0 vs HA:inlet-outlet&lt;0, where  is the mean BOD. [Negative differences represent larger values at the outlet, which implies that BOD is higher in the water released from the facility. Thus, HA represents the owners concern.] A 2-Sample t-Test is required because  a quantitative variable (BOD level) was measured, two groups are being compared (outlet and inlet), and the individuals in the groups were INdependent (note that it said that the outlet samples came from different times then the inlet samples). The data appear to be part of an observational study with no obvious randomization. The assumptions are met because  n = 20&gt;15 and the histograms (Figure 27.2) are inconclusive about the shape because of the small sample size in each group (it appears that the inlet data is not strongly skewed, whereas the outlet data is skewed, which may invalidate the results of this hypothesis test; however, I continued to make a complete example), individuals in the two groups are independent as discussed above, and the variances appear to be equal because the Levenes test p-value (=0.5913) is greater than . xinlet-xoutlet = 6.65 - 8.69 = -2.03 (Table 27.3). t = -8.994 with 18 df (Table 27.3). p-value 0.00000002 (Table 27.3). H0 is rejected because the p-value &lt; . The average BOD is greater at the outlet than at the inlet to the aquaculture facility. Thus, the aquaculture facility appears to add to the biological oxygen demand of the water and the farmers concern is warranted. I am 90% confident that the mean BOD measurement at the outlet is AT LEAST 1.73 GREATER than the mean BOD measurement at the inlet (Table 27.3).

"],["RChi.html", "Module 28 Chi-Square in R 28.1 Chi-Square Tests 28.2 Goodness-of-Fit Test in R", " Module 28 Chi-Square in R In Modules 20 and 21 you learned the theory and how to perform the calculations required to complete the 11 steps (Section 17.1) of a hypothesis test for chi-square and goodness-of-fit tests. In this module, you will learn how to perform the required calculations from raw data using R. Methods in this module require the NCStats package (as always) and the ggplot2 package (for making graphs). library(NCStats) library(ggplot2) 28.1 Chi-Square Tests 28.1.1 Data formats Consider the following example for this section. Daniel Weiss (in 100% American) reported the results of a survey of 300 first-time fathers from four different hospitals (labeled as A, B, C, and D). Each father was asked if he was present (or not) in the delivery room when his child was born. The results of the survey are in FatherPresent.csv (data,meta). Use these data to determine if there is a difference, at the 5% level, in the proportion of fathers present in the delivery room among the four hospitals. The data are loaded and examined below. fp &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/FatherPresent.csv&quot;) str(fp) #R&gt; &#39;data.frame&#39;: 300 obs. of 2 variables: #R&gt; $ hospital: chr &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; ... #R&gt; $ father : chr &quot;Present&quot; &quot;Present&quot; &quot;Present&quot; &quot;Present&quot; ... headtail(fp) #R&gt; hospital father #R&gt; 1 A Present #R&gt; 2 A Present #R&gt; 3 A Present #R&gt; 298 D Absent #R&gt; 299 D Absent #R&gt; 300 D Absent The chi-square test calculations can be made from either raw data, that are then summarized, or data that has already been summarized. Raw data, as are given here, should be in stacked format and then summarized to a two-way frequency table with xtabs() using a formula of the form ~cvarRow+cvarCol as described in Section 10.1. The result should be saved to an object for later use. ( fp.obs &lt;- xtabs(~hospital+father,data=fp) ) #R&gt; father #R&gt; hospital Absent Present #R&gt; A 9 66 #R&gt; B 15 60 #R&gt; C 18 57 #R&gt; D 19 56 IF the raw data do NOT exist, but a summary table is provided, then those summary statistics must be entered into an object using matrix(). The summarized frequencies must first be entered into a vector with the first COLUMN of values followed by the second COLUMN and so on. This vector is then the first argument to matrix(), which will also include the number of columns in the frequency table in ncol=. For example, the same observed table from above would be constructed as follows. fp.obs &lt;- matrix(c(9,15,18,19,66,60,57,56),ncol=2) It is useful to augment this matrix with column and row names as follows. colnames(fp.obs) &lt;- c(&quot;Absent&quot;,&quot;Present&quot;) rownames(fp.obs) &lt;- c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;,&quot;D&quot;) fp.obs #R&gt; Absent Present #R&gt; A 9 66 #R&gt; B 15 60 #R&gt; C 18 57 #R&gt; D 19 56 The observed table must contain frequencies, not proportions or percentages (dont use percTable()), without marginal totals (dont use addMargins()). 28.1.2 Chi-Square test in R The Chi-Square Test is performed with chisq.test(), which takes the observed frequency table as the first argument and correct=FALSE so that the continuity correction is not used.104 The results of chisq.test() should be assigned to an object. The Chi-Square test statistic and p-value are extracted by simply printing the saved object. The expected frequency table is returned by appending $expected to the saved object. ( fp.chi &lt;- chisq.test(fp.obs,correct=FALSE) ) #R&gt; Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test with fp.obs #R&gt; X-squared = 5.0003, df = 3, p-value = 0.1718 fp.chi$expected #R&gt; Absent Present #R&gt; A 15.25 59.75 #R&gt; B 15.25 59.75 #R&gt; C 15.25 59.75 #R&gt; D 15.25 59.75 From the results above the expected table for Step 5 is shown at the end, the observed table for Step 6 was shown further above, the 2 test statistic for Step 7 is 5.000, and the p-value for Step 8 is 0.172 (with 3 df). The observed frequency table can be from matrix() or xtabs(). Rejecting the null hypothesis in a Chi-Square Test indicates that there is some difference in the distribution of individuals into the levels of the response variable among some of the groups. A post-hoc method for helping determine which groups differ is obtained by observing the Pearson residuals. A Pearson residual is computed for each cell in the table as, \\[ \\frac{Observed-Expected}{\\sqrt{Expected}} \\] which is the appropriately signed square root of the parts in the 2 test statistic calculation. Therefore, cells that have Pearson residuals far from zero contributed substantially to the large 2 test statistic that resulted in a small p-value and the ultimate rejection of H0. Patterns in where the large Pearson residuals are found may allow one to qualitatively determine which groups differ and, thus, which levels of the response differ the most. This process will be illustrated more fully in the examples and review exercises. The Pearson residuals are obtained from the saved chisq.test() object by appending $residuals. fp.chi$residuals #R&gt; Absent Present #R&gt; A -1.60046100 0.80855778 #R&gt; B -0.06401844 0.03234231 #R&gt; C 0.70420284 -0.35576543 #R&gt; D 0.96027660 -0.48513467 These residuals are all relatively small which is not surprising given that the H0 was not rejected. 28.1.3 Example - Apostle Islands Plants Below are the 11-steps for completing a full hypothesis test (Section 17.1) for the following situation: In her Senior Capstone project a Northland College student recorded the dominant (i.e., most abundant) plant species in 100 randomly selected plots on both Devils Island and the Bayfield Peninsula (i.e., the mainland). There were a total of six species (one group was called other) recorded (labeled as A, B, C, D, E, and F). The results are shown in the table below. Determine, at the 5% level, if the frequency of dominant species differs between the two locations. A B C D E F Sum Devils Is 34 22 14 13 12 5 100 Mainland 62 12 8 7 6 5 100 Sum 96 34 22 20 18 10 200  = 0.05. H0: the distribution of dominant plants species is the same between Devils Island and the Mainland vs. HA: the distribution of dominant plants species is NOT the same between Devils Island and the Mainland. A Chi-Square Test is required because  a categorical variable with six levels (plant species) was recorded and two groups are being compared (Devils Island and Mainland). The data appear to be part of an observational study where the plots were randomly selected. There are more than five individuals in each cell of the expected table (Table 28.1). The statistic is the observed frequency table given in the background. 2=16.54 with 5 df (Table 28.2). p-value=0.0055 (Table 28.2). H0 is rejected because the p-value is &lt; . There does appear to be a significant difference in the distribution of the dominant plants between the two sites. A look at the Pearson residuals (Table 28.3) and the row-percentage table (Table 28.4) both suggest that the biggest difference between the two locations is due to plant A.105 Table 28.1: Expected frequency table for dominant plant species on Devils Island and the Bayfield Peninsula.

Herriges and King (1999) examined modes of fishing for a large number of recreational saltwater users in southern California. One of the questions asked in their Southern California Sportfishing Survey was what mode they used for fishing  from the beach, from a fishing pier, on a private boat, or on a chartered boat. The results to this question, along with other data not used here, are found in FishingModes.csv (data, meta). One hypothesis of interest states that two-thirds of the users will fish from a boat, split evenly between private and charter boats, while the other one-third will fish from land, also split evenly between those fishing on the beach and those from a pier. Use the data in the mode variable of the data file to determine if this hypothesis is supported at the 10% level. The data are loaded and examined below (the headtail() only shows a few variables). sf &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/droglenc/NCData/master/FishingModes.csv&quot;) str(sf) #R&gt; &#39;data.frame&#39;: 1182 obs. of 12 variables: #R&gt; $ mode : chr &quot;charter&quot; &quot;charter&quot; &quot;boat&quot; &quot;pier&quot; ... #R&gt; $ price : num 182.9 34.5 24.3 15.1 41.5 ... #R&gt; $ catch : num 0.5391 0.4671 0.2413 0.0789 0.1082 ... #R&gt; $ pbeach : num 157.9 15.1 161.9 15.1 106.9 ... #R&gt; $ ppier : num 157.9 15.1 161.9 15.1 106.9 ... #R&gt; $ pboat : num 157.9 10.5 24.3 55.9 41.5 ... #R&gt; $ pcharter: num 182.9 34.5 59.3 84.9 71 ... #R&gt; $ cbeach : num 0.0678 0.1049 0.5333 0.0678 0.0678 ... #R&gt; $ cpier : num 0.0503 0.0451 0.4522 0.0789 0.0503 ... #R&gt; $ cboat : num 0.26 0.157 0.241 0.164 0.108 ... #R&gt; $ ccharter: num 0.539 0.467 1.027 0.539 0.324 ... #R&gt; $ income : num 7083 1250 3750 2083 4583 ... headtail(sf,which=c(&quot;mode&quot;,&quot;price&quot;,&quot;catch&quot;)) #R&gt; mode price catch #R&gt; 1 charter 182.930 0.5391 #R&gt; 2 charter 34.534 0.4671 #R&gt; 3 boat 24.334 0.2413 #R&gt; 1180 pier 65.036 0.4522 #R&gt; 1181 beach 36.636 0.5333 #R&gt; 1182 boat 235.436 0.6817 As with the Chi-Square Test, the Goodness-of-Fit test can be made from either raw data, that are then summarized, or data that has already been summarized. Raw data are summarized into a one-way observed frequency table using xtabs() with a formula of ~cvarRow as described in Section 4.2.1.1. The results should be saved to an object for later use. ( sf.obs &lt;- xtabs(~mode,data=sf) ) #R&gt; mode #R&gt; beach boat charter pier #R&gt; 134 418 452 178 IF the raw data do NOT exist, but a summary table is provided, then those summary statistics must be entered into an object using c(). Each item can be named in c() as shown below, which will make the results easier to interpret. For example, the same observed table from above would be constructed as follows. ( sf.obs &lt;- c(beach=134,boat=418,charter=452,pier=178) ) #R&gt; beach boat charter pier #R&gt; 134 418 452 178 28.2.2 Expected Table The R function to perform a Goodness-of-Fit test described in the next section requires a vector of expected proportions in each group defined by the theoretical distribution in the hypotheses. This vector does not actually have to be proportions, per se, but it must be values that are directly proportional to the expected proportions. Thus, the vector can contain the proportions, percentages, actual expected values, or any other set of values that are related to the expected proportions by a constant. In this example, the theoretical distribution suggests that two-thirds of the users will fish from a boat, split evenly between private and charter boats, while the other one-third will fish from land, also split even between those fishing on the beach and those from a pier. With this, the expected proportions are \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) for a private boat, \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) for a charter boat, \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) for beach, and \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) for a pier. These expected proportions could be entered into a vector in any of the following ways, as each way differs only by a constant value. exp.p &lt;- c(beach=1/6,boat=1/3,charter=1/3,pier=1/6) #proportions exp.p &lt;- c(beach=16.67,boat=33.33,charter=33.33,pier=16.67) #percentages exp.p &lt;- c(beach=1,boat=2,charter=2,pier=1) #ratios exp.p &lt;- c(beach=197,boat=394,charter=394,pier=197) #expected values Enter the expected proportions in the same order as the observed frequencies. 28.2.3 Goodness-of-Fit Test in R The Goodness-of-Fit Test is computed with chisq.test() with the observed frequency table as the first argument and the following arguments: p=: a vector of expected proportions for the levels of the theoretical distribution. rescale.p=TRUE: rescales the values in p= to sum to 1. Rescaling is useful if the proportions in p= were rounded or are expected frequencies. correct=FALSE: indicates to not use a continuity correction. Always use rescale.p=TRUE and correct=FALSE. The results from chisq.test() should be assigned to an object so that useful information can be extracted. ( sf.gof &lt;- chisq.test(sf.obs,p=exp.p,rescale.p=TRUE,correct=FALSE) ) #R&gt; Chi-squared test for given probabilities with sf.obs #R&gt; X-squared = 31.9797, df = 3, p-value = 5.285e-07 From the results above the 2 test statistic for Step 7 is 31.980, and the p-value for Step 8 is 0.00000053 (with 3 df). The observed table for Step 6 was shown further above. The expected table for Step 5 is extracted from the chisq.test() object as follows. sf.gof$expected #R&gt; beach boat charter pier #R&gt; 197 394 394 197 Rejecting H0 in a Goodness-of-Fit test simply indicates that the observed distribution differs from the theoretical distribution, but it is not clear exactly where the difference occurs. The following code can be used to neatly put the observed values, expected values, and Pearson residuals next to each other, which may be helpful for explaining any differences that were observed. cbind(obs=sf.gof$observed,exp=sf.gof$expected,resids=sf.gof$residuals) #R&gt; obs exp resids #R&gt; beach 134 197 -4.488564 #R&gt; boat 418 394 1.209103 #R&gt; charter 452 394 2.921998 #R&gt; pier 178 197 -1.353694 In this case it is clear that those respondents that answered beach were much lower than expected and those that answered charter were greater than expected. Another way to identify where differences occurred is to examine confidence intervals for the proportions of individuals in each level. These confidence intervals are extracted from the saved chisq.test() object with . gofCI(sf.gof,digits=3) #R&gt; p.obs p.LCI p.UCI p.exp #R&gt; beach 0.113 0.097 0.133 0.167 #R&gt; boat 0.354 0.327 0.381 0.333 #R&gt; charter 0.382 0.355 0.410 0.333 #R&gt; pier 0.151 0.131 0.172 0.167 Again, the confidence interval for the proportion that responded beach is less than the expected proportion and the proportion that answered charter is greater than expected. 28.2.4 Example - Loggerhead Shrikes Below are the 11-steps for completing a full hypothesis test (Section 17.1) for the following situation: Bohall-Wood (1987) constructed 24 random 16-km transects along roads in counties near Gainesville, FL. Two observers censused each transect once every 2 weeks from 18 October 1981 to 30 October 1982, by driving 32 km/h and scanning both sides of the road for perched and flying shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus). The habitat, whether the bird was on the roadside or actually in the habitat, and the perch type were recorded for each shrike observed. Habitats were grouped into five categories. The number of shrikes observed in each habitat was 1456 in open areas, 43 in midsuccessional, 112 in scattered trees, 44 in woods, and 6 in wetlands. Separate analyses were used to construct the proportion of habitat available in each of the five habitat types. These results were as follows: 0.358 open, 0.047 midsuccessional, 0.060 scattered trees, 0.531 woods, and 0.004 wetlands. Use these data to determine, at the 5% level, if shrikes are using the habitat in proportion to its availability. =0.05. H0: distribution of habitat use by shrikes is the same as the proportions of available habitat vs. HA: distribution of habitat use by shrikes is NOT the same as the proportions of available habitat. A Goodness-of-Fit Test is required because  a categorical variable was recorded (habitat use), a single group (or population) was considered (shrikes in this area), and the observed distribution is compared to a theoretical distribution. The data appear to be part of an observational study where the individuals were not randomly selected but the transects upon which they were observed were. There are more than five individuals expected in each habitat level (Table 28.5). The statistic is the observed frequency table in Table 28.5. 2=2345.1 with 4 df (Table 28.6). p-value&lt;0.00005 (Table 28.6). H0 is rejected because the p-value&lt;. The shrikes do not appear to use habitats in the same proportions as the availability of the habitat. The 95% confidence intervals for the proportion of use in each habitat level are in Table 28.7. From these results it appears that the shrikes use the open habitat much more often and the woods habitat mush less often than would be expected if they used all habitats in proportion to their availability.

The continuity correction should usually be used. When Plant A is removed from the observed table, the Chi-Square Test performed on the remaining plant species showed no difference in the distribution of the remaining plants between the two locations (p=0.9239). Thus, most of the difference in plant distributions between Devils Island and the Mainland appears to be due primarily to plant A with more of plant A found on the Mainland than on Devils Island.
